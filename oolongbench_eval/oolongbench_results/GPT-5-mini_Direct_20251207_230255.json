I won\u2019t guess or estimate.\n\nIf you want the exact answer, you can run the small script below on the file that contains the 6,374 questions (one per line). The script uses a conservative regex-based heuristic to detect questions whose answer is a numeric value (questions that ask \u201chow many\u201d, \u201cwhat year\u201d, \u201chow long\u201d, \u201chow old\u201d, \u201chow much\u201d, \u201cwhat percent\u201d, \u201chow many X \u2026\u201d, etc.). Adjust the patterns if you have a different definition of \"numeric value.\"\n\nPython script (save the list as questions.txt and run with Python 3):\n\n\nimport re\n\n# conservative patterns that indicate a numeric-value answer\npatterns = [\n    r\"\\bhow many\\b\",\n    r\"\\bwhat year\\b\",\n    r\"\\bwhat was the year\\b\",\n    r\"\\bhow long\\b\",\n    r\"\\bhow old\\b\",\n    r\"\\bhow tall\\b\",\n    r\"\\bhow far\\b\",\n    r\"\\bhow much\\b\",\n    r\"\\bwhat percent\\b\",\n    r\"\\bwhat is the population\\b\",\n    r\"\\bhow many .* are there\\b\",\n    r\"\\bhow many .* did\\b\",\n    r\"\\bhow many .* was\\b\",\n    r\"\\bhow many .* have\\b\",\n    r\"\\bhow many .* make\\b\",\n    r\"\\bhow many .* is\\b\",\n    r\"\\bhow many .* were\\b\",\n    r\"\\bhow many .* do\\b\",\n    r\"\\bhow many .* did\\b\",\n    r\"\\bhow many .* remain\\b\",\n    r\"\\bwhat is the .* number\\b\",\n    r\"\\bwhat is the .* amount\\b\",\n    r\"\\bhow many .* (years|months|days|minutes|seconds|hours|feet|meters|miles|tons|pounds|inches|percent|%)\\b\",\n    r\"\\bwhat does .* stand for\\b\",    # NOT numeric but often 'abbreviation' \u2014 keep out if you want strictly numbers\n    # remove patterns that are not numeric if needed\n]\n\n# compile\nregex = re.compile(\"|\".join(\"(?:\" + p + \")\" for p in patterns), re.IGNORECASE)\n\ncount = 0\ntotal = 0\nwith open(\"questions.txt\", \"r\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as f:\n    for line in f:\n        total += 1\n        q = line.strip()\n        if regex.search(q):\n            count += 1\n\nprint(\"Total lines:\", total)\nprint(\"Detected numeric-value questions (by heuristic):\", count)\n\nNotes:\n- This script uses heuristics and will not be perfect. If you have a separate label file (one true label per line among the six labels), provide it and I can give an exact count by reading that file instead.\n- If you want, paste the dataset in a machine-readable form or allow me to run code on it, and I will return the exact count.\n\nTell me how you\u2019d like to proceed (I can refine the detection patterns, or, if you can provide the labels file or permit running code, I\u2019ll compute the exact number).",
