# Instructions

You are being benchmarked. You will see the output of a git log command, and from that must infer the current state of a file. Think carefully, as you must output the exact state of the file to earn full marks.

**Important:** Your goal is to reproduce the file's content *exactly* as it exists at the final commit, even if the code appears broken, buggy, or contains obvious errors. Do **not** try to "fix" the code. Attempting to correct issues will result in a poor score, as this benchmark evaluates your ability to reproduce the precise state of the file based on its history.

# Required Response Format

Wrap the content of the file in triple backticks (```). Any text outside the final closing backticks will be ignored. End your response after outputting the closing backticks.

# Example Response

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
print('Hello, world!')
```

    [compiler][rewrite] PropagateScopeDeps hir rewrite
    
    Resubmission of #30079 -- core logic unchanged, but needed to rebase past #30573
    
    ### Quick background
    #### Temporaries
    
    The compiler currently treats temporaries and named variables (e.g. `x`) differently in this pass.
    - named variables may be reassigned (in fact, since we're running after LeaveSSA, a single named identifier's IdentifierId may map to multiple `Identifier` instances -- each with its own scope and mutable range)
    - temporaries are replaced with their represented expressions during codegen. This is correct (mostly correct, see #29878) as we're careful to always lower the correct evaluation semantics. However, since we rewrite reactive scopes entirely (to if/else blocks), we need to track temporaries that a scope produces in `ReactiveScope.declarations` and later promote them to named variables.
    In the same example, $4, $5, and $6 need to be promoted: $2 ->`t0`,  $5 ->`t1`, and $6 ->`t2`.
    ```js
    [1] $2 = LoadGlobal(global) foo
    [2] $3 = LoadLocal bar$1
    scope 0:
      [3] $4 = Call $2(<unknown> $3)
    scope 1:
      [4] $5 = Object {  }
    scope 2:
      [5] $6 = Object { a: $4, b: $5 }
    [6] $8 = StoreLocal Const x$7 = $6
    ```
    
    #### Dependencies
    `ReactiveScope.dependencies` records the set of (read-only) values that a reactive scope is dependent on. This is currently limited to just variables (named variables from source and promoted temporaries) and property-loads.
    All dependencies we record need to be hoistable -- i.e. reordered to just before the ReactiveScope begins. Not all PropertyLoads are hoistable.
    
    In this example, we should not evaluate `obj.a.b` without before creating x and checking `objIsNull`.
    ```js
    // reduce-reactive-deps/no-uncond.js
    function useFoo({ obj, objIsNull }) {
      const x = [];
      if (isFalse(objIsNull)) {
        x.push(obj.a.b);
      }
      return x;
    }
    ```
    
    While other memoization strategies with different constraints exist, the current compiler requires that `ReactiveScope.dependencies` be re-orderable to the beginning of the reactive scope. But.. `PropertyLoad`s from null values will throw `TypeError`. This means that evaluating hoisted dependencies should throw if and only if the source program throws. (It is also a bug if source throws and compiler output does not throw. See https://github.com/facebook/react-forget/pull/2709)
    
    ---
    ### Rough high level overview
    1. Pass 1
    Walk over instructions to gather every temporary used outside of its defining scope (same as ReactiveFunction version). These determine the sidemaps we produce, as temporaries used outside of their declaring scopes get promoted to named variables later (and are not considered hoistable rvals).
    2. Pass 2 (collectTemporariesSidemap)
    Walk over instructions to generate a sidemap of temporary identifier -> named variable and property path (e.g. `$3 -> {obj: props, path: ["a", "b"]}`)
    2. Pass 2 (collectHoistablePropertyLoads)
      a. Build a sidemap of block -> accessed variables and properties (e.g. `bb0 -> [ {obj: props, path: ["a", "b"]} ]`)
      b. Propagate "non-nullness" i.e. variables and properties for which we can safely evaluate `PropertyLoad`.
      A basic block can unconditionally read from identifier X if any of the following applies:
        - the block itself reads from identifier X
        - all predecessors of the block read from identifier X
        - all successors of the block read from identifier X
    4. Pass 3: (collectDependencies)
    Walks over instructions again to record dependencies and declarations, using the previously produced sidemaps. We do not record any control-flow here
    5. Merge every scope's recorded dependencies with the set of hoistable PropertyLoads
    
    Tested by syncing internally and (1) checking compilation output differences ([internal link](https://www.internalfb.com/intern/everpaste/?handle=GPCfUBt_HCoy_S4EAJDVFJyJJMR0bsIXAAAB)), running internally e2e tests ([internal link](https://fburl.com/sandcastle/cs5mlkxq))

    ### Followups:
    1. Rewrite function expression deps
    This change produces much more optimal output as the compiler now uses the function CFG to understand which variables / paths are assumed to be non-null. However, it may exacerbate [this function-expr hoisting bug](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/compiler/packages/babel-plugin-react-compiler/src/__tests__/fixtures/compiler/bug-invalid-hoisting-functionexpr.tsx). A short term fix here is to simply call some form of `collectNonNullObjects` on every function expression to find hoistable variable / paths. In the longer term, we should refactor out `FunctionExpression.deps`.
    
    2. Enable optional paths
    (a) don't count optional load temporaries as dependencies (e.g. `collectOptionalLoadRValues(...)`).
    (b) record optional paths in both collectHoistablePropertyLoads and dependency collection

+ * Here, it's invalid for scope@1 to take `arr.length` as a dependency instead

    [compiler] Optional chaining for dependencies (HIR rewrite)
    
    Adds HIR version of `PropagateScopeDeps` to handle optional chaining.
    
    Internally, this improves memoization on ~4% of compiled files (internal links: [1](https://www.internalfb.com/intern/paste/P1610406497/))
    
    Summarizing the changes in this PR.
    1. `CollectOptionalChainDependencies` recursively traverses optional blocks down to the base. From the base, we build up a set of `baseIdentifier.propertyA?.propertyB` mappings.
    The tricky bit here is that optional blocks sometimes reference other optional blocks that are *not* part of the same chain e.g. a(c?.d)?.d. See code + comments in `traverseOptionalBlock` for how we avoid concatenating unrelated blocks.
    
    2. Adding optional chains into non-null object calculation.
    (Note that marking `a?.b` as 'non-null' means that `a?.b.c` is safe to evaluate, *not* `(a?.b).c`. Happy to rename this / reword comments accordingly if there's a better term)
    This pass is split into two stages. (1) collecting non-null objects by block and (2) propagating non-null objects across blocks. The only significant change here was to (2). We add an extra reduce step `X=Reduce(Union(X, Intersect(X_neighbors)))` to merge optional and non-optional nodes (e.g. nonNulls=`{a, a?.b}` reduces to `{a, a.b}`)
    
    3. Adding optional chains into dependency calculation.
    This was the trickiest. We need to take the "maximal" property chain as a dependency. Prior to this PR, we avoided taking subpaths e.g. `a.b` of `a.b.c` as dependencies by only visiting non-PropertyLoad/LoadLocal instructions. This effectively only recorded the property-path at site-of-use.
    
        Unfortunately, this *quite* doesn't work for optional chains for a few reasons:
        - We would need to skip relevant `StoreLocal`/`Branch terminal` instructions (but only those within optional blocks that have been successfully read).
        - Given an optional chain, either (1) only a subpath or (2) the entire path can be represented as a PropertyLoad. We cannot directly add the last hoistable optional-block as a dependency as MethodCalls are an edge case e.g. given a?.b.c(), we should depend on `a?.b`, not `a?.b.c`
          This means that we add its dependency at either the innermost unhoistable optional-block or when encountering it within its phi-join.
    
    4. Handle optional chains in DeriveMinimalDependenciesHIR.
    This was also a bit tricky to formulate. Ideally, we would avoid a 2^3 case join (cond | uncond cfg, optional | not optional load, access | dependency). This PR attempts to simplify by building two trees
        1. First add each hoistable path into a tree containing `Optional | NonOptional` nodes.
        2. Then add each dependency into another tree containing `Optional | NonOptional`, `Access | Dependency` nodes, truncating the dependency at the earliest non-hoistable node (i.e. non-matching pair when walking the hoistable tree)

    [compiler][hir] Only hoist always-accessed PropertyLoads from function decls (#31066)
    
    Stack from [ghstack](https://github.com/ezyang/ghstack) (oldest at
    bottom):
    * __->__ #31066
    * #31032
    
    Prior to this PR, we consider all of a nested function's accessed paths
    as 'hoistable' (to the basic block in which the function was defined).
    Now, we traverse nested functions and find all paths hoistable to their
    *entry block*.
    
    Note that this only replaces the *hoisting* part of function
    declarations, not dependencies. This realistically only affects optional
    chains within functions, which always get truncated to its inner
    non-optional path (see
    [todo-infer-function-uncond-optionals-hoisted.tsx](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/576f3c0aa898cb99da1b7bf15317756e25c13708/compiler/packages/babel-plugin-react-compiler/src/__tests__/fixtures/compiler/propagate-scope-deps-hir-fork/reduce-reactive-deps/todo-infer-function-uncond-optionals-hoisted.tsx))
    
    See newly added test fixtures for details
    
    Update: Note that toggling `enableTreatFunctionDepsAsConditional` makes
    a non-trivial impact on granularity of inferred deps (i.e. we find that
    function declarations uniquely identify some paths as hoistable).
    Snapshot comparison of internal code shows ~2.5% of files get worse
    dependencies ([internal
    link](https://www.internalfb.com/phabricator/paste/view/P1625792186))

    [compiler] Represent phis with places rather than identifiers
    
    Summary:
    The fact that phis are identifiers rather than places is unfortunate in a few cases. In some later analyses, we might wish to know whether a phi is reactive, but we don't have an easy way to do that currently.
    
    Most of the changes here is just replacing phi.id with phi.place.identifier and such. Interesting bits are EnterSSA (several functions now take places rather than identifiers, and InferReactivePlaces now needs to mark places as reactive explicitly.

    [compiler] bugfix for hoistable deps for nested functions (#31345)
    
    `PropertyPathRegistry` is responsible for uniqueing identifier and
    property paths. This is necessary for the hoistability CFG merging logic
    which takes unions and intersections of these nodes to determine a basic
    block's hoistable reads, as a function of its neighbors. We also depend
    on this to merge optional chained and non-optional chained property
    paths
    
    This fixes a small bug in #31066 in which we create a new registry for
    nested functions. Now, we use the same registry for a component / hook
    and all its inner functions

    [compiler] Collect temporaries and optional chains from inner functions (#31346)
    
    Recursively collect identifier / property loads and optional chains from
    inner functions. This PR is in preparation for #31200
    
    Previously, we only did this in `collectHoistablePropertyLoads` to
    understand hoistable property loads from inner functions.
    1. collectTemporariesSidemap
    2. collectOptionalChainSidemap
    3. collectHoistablePropertyLoads
    - ^ this recursively calls `collectTemporariesSidemap`,
    `collectOptionalChainSidemap`, and `collectOptionalChainSidemap` on
    inner functions
    4. collectDependencies
    
    Now, we have
    1. collectTemporariesSidemap
    - recursively record identifiers in inner functions. Note that we track
    all temporaries in the same map as `IdentifierIds` are currently unique
    across functions
    2. collectOptionalChainSidemap
        - recursively records optional chain sidemaps in inner functions
    3. collectHoistablePropertyLoads
        - (unchanged, except to remove recursive collection of temporaries)
    4. collectDependencies
    - unchanged: to be modified to recursively collect dependencies in next

    [compiler] Fix: ref.current now correctly reactive (#31521)
    
    We were previously filtering out `ref.current` dependencies in
    propagateScopeDependencies:checkValidDependency`. This is incorrect.
    
    Instead, we now always take a dependency on ref values (the outer box)
    as they may be reactive. Pruning is done in
    pruneNonReactiveDependencies.
    
    This PR includes a small patch to `collectReactiveIdentifier`. Prior to
    this, we conservatively assumed that pruned scopes always produced
    reactive declarations. This assumption fixed a bug with non-reactivity,
    but some of these declarations are `useRef` calls. Now we have special
    handling for this case
    ```js
    // This often produces a pruned scope
    React.useRef(1);
    ```

    [compiler] Stop using function `dependencies` in propagateScopeDeps (#31200)
    
    Recursively visit inner function instructions to extract dependencies
    instead of using `LoweredFunction.dependencies` directly.
    
    This is currently gated by enableFunctionDependencyRewrite, which needs
    to be removed before we delete `LoweredFunction.dependencies` altogether
    (#31204).
    
    Some nice side effects
    - optional-chaining deps for inner functions
    - full DCE and outlining for inner functions (see #31202)
    - fewer extraneous instructions (see #31204)

    [compiler] Context variables as dependencies (#31582)
    
    We previously didn't track context variables in the hoistable values
    sidemap of `propagateScopeDependencies`. This was overly conservative as
    we *do* track the mutable range of context variables, and it is safe to
    hoist accesses to context variables after their last direct / aliased
    maybe-assignment.
    
    ```js
    function Component({value}) {
      // start of mutable range for `x`
      let x = DEFAULT;
      const setX = () => x = value;
      const aliasedSet = maybeAlias(setX);
      maybeCall(aliasedSet);
      // end of mutable range for `x`
    
      // here, we should be able to take x (and property reads
      // off of x) as dependencies
      return <Jsx value={x} />
    }
    ```

    [compiler] Delete LoweredFunction.dependencies and hoisted instructions (#32096)
    
    LoweredFunction dependencies were exclusively used for dependency
    extraction (in `propagateScopeDeps`). Now that we have a
    `propagateScopeDepsHIR` that recursively traverses into nested
    functions, we can delete `dependencies` and their associated synthetic
    `LoadLocal`/`PropertyLoad` instructions.
    
    [Internal snapshot
    diff](https://www.internalfb.com/phabricator/paste/view/P1716950202) for
    this change shows ~.2% of files changed. I [read through ~60 of the
    changed
    files](https://www.internalfb.com/phabricator/paste/view/P1733074307)
    - most changes are due to better outlining (due to better DCE)
    - a few changes in memo inference are due to changed ordering
    ```
    // source
    arr.map(() => contextVar.inner);
    
    // previous instructions
    $0 = LoadLocal arr
    $1 = $0.map
    // Below instructions are synthetic
    $2 = LoadLocal contextVar
    $3 = $2.inner
    $4 = Function deps=$3 context=contextVar {
      ...
    }
    ```
    - a few changes are effectively bugfixes (see
    `aliased-nested-scope-fn-expr`)

    [compiler] Represent array accesses with PropertyLoad (#32287)
    
    Prior to this PR, our HIR represented property access with numeric
    literals (e.g. `myVar[0]`) as ComputedLoads. This means that they were
    subject to some deopts (most notably, not being easily dedupable /
    hoistable as dependencies).
    
    Now, `PropertyLoad`, `PropertyStore`, etc reference numeric and string
    literals (although not yet string literals that aren't valid babel
    identifiers). The difference between PropertyLoad and ComputedLoad is
    fuzzy now (maybe we should rename these).
    - PropertyLoad: property keys are string and numeric literals, only when
    the string literals are valid babel identifiers
    - ComputedLoad: non-valid babel identifier string literals (rare) and
    other non-literal expressions
    
    The biggest feature from this PR is that it trivially enables
    array-indicing expressions as dependencies. The compiler can also
    specify global and imported types for arrays (e.g. return value of
    `useState`)
    
    
    I'm happy to close this if it complicates more than it helps --
    alternative options are to entirely rely on instruction reordering-based
    approaches like ReactiveGraphIR or make dependency-specific parsing +
    hoisting logic more robust.

    [compiler] Fallback for inferred effect dependencies (#32984)
    
    When effect dependencies cannot be inferred due to memoization-related
    bailouts or unexpected mutable ranges (which currently often have to do
    with writes to refs), fall back to traversing the effect lambda itself.
    
    This fallback uses the same logic as PropagateScopeDependencies:
    1. Collect a sidemap of loads and property loads
    2. Find hoistable accesses from the control flow graph. Note that here,
    we currently take into account the mutable ranges of instructions (see
    `mutate-after-useeffect-granular-access` fixture)
    3. Collect the set of property paths accessed by the effect
    4. Merge to get the set of minimal dependencies

    [compiler][bugfix] expand StoreContext to const / let / function variants (#32747)
    
    ```js
    function Component() {
      useEffect(() => {
        let hasCleanedUp = false;
        document.addEventListener(..., () => hasCleanedUp ? foo() : bar());
        // effect return values shouldn't be typed as frozen
        return () => {
          hasCleanedUp = true;
        }
      };
    }
    ```
    ### Problem
    `PruneHoistedContexts` currently strips hoisted declarations and
    rewrites the first `StoreContext` reassignment to a declaration. For
    example, in the following example, instruction 0 is removed while a
    synthetic `DeclareContext let` is inserted before instruction 1.
    
    ```js
    // source
    const cb = () => x; // reference that causes x to be hoisted
    
    let x = 4;
    x = 5;
    
    // React Compiler IR
    [0] DeclareContext HoistedLet 'x'
    ...
    [1] StoreContext reassign 'x' = 4
    [2] StoreContext reassign 'x' = 5
    ```
    
    Currently, we don't account for `DeclareContext let`. As a result, we're
    rewriting to insert duplicate declarations.
    ```js
    // source
    const cb = () => x; // reference that causes x to be hoisted
    
    let x;
    x = 5;
    
    // React Compiler IR
    [0] DeclareContext HoistedLet 'x'
    ...
    [1] DeclareContext Let 'x'
    [2] StoreContext reassign 'x' = 5
    ```
    
    ### Solution
    
    Instead of always lowering context variables to a DeclareContext
    followed by a StoreContext reassign, we can keep `kind: 'Const' | 'Let'
    | 'Reassign' | etc` on StoreContext.
    Pros:
    - retain more information in HIR, so we can codegen easily `const` and
    `let` context variable declarations back
    - pruning hoisted `DeclareContext` instructions is simple.
    
    Cons:
    - passes are more verbose as we need to check for both `DeclareContext`
    and `StoreContext` declarations
    
    ~(note: also see alternative implementation in
    https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/32745)~
    
    ### Testing
    Context variables are tricky. I synced and diffed changes in a large
    meta codebase and feel pretty confident about landing this. About 0.01%
    of compiled files changed. Among these changes, ~25% were [direct
    bugfixes](https://www.internalfb.com/phabricator/paste/view/P1800029094).
    The [other
    changes](https://www.internalfb.com/phabricator/paste/view/P1800028575)
    were primarily due to changed (corrected) mutable ranges from
    https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/33047. I tried to represent most
    interesting changes in new test fixtures
