# Instructions

You are being benchmarked. You will see the output of a git log command, and from that must infer the current state of a file. Think carefully, as you must output the exact state of the file to earn full marks.

**Important:** Your goal is to reproduce the file's content *exactly* as it exists at the final commit, even if the code appears broken, buggy, or contains obvious errors. Do **not** try to "fix" the code. Attempting to correct issues will result in a poor score, as this benchmark evaluates your ability to reproduce the precise state of the file based on its history.

# Required Response Format

Wrap the content of the file in triple backticks (```). Any text outside the final closing backticks will be ignored. End your response after outputting the closing backticks.

# Example Response

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
print('Hello, world!')
```

    tldraw zero - package shuffle (#1710)
    
    This PR moves code between our packages so that:
    - @tldraw/editor is a “core” library with the engine and canvas but no
    shapes, tools, or other things
    - @tldraw/tldraw contains everything particular to the experience we’ve
    built for tldraw
    
    At first look, this might seem like a step away from customization and
    configuration, however I believe it greatly increases the configuration
    potential of the @tldraw/editor while also providing a more accurate
    reflection of what configuration options actually exist for
    @tldraw/tldraw.
    
    ## Library changes
    
    @tldraw/editor re-exports its dependencies and @tldraw/tldraw re-exports
    @tldraw/editor.
    
    - users of @tldraw/editor WITHOUT @tldraw/tldraw should almost always
    only import things from @tldraw/editor.
    - users of @tldraw/tldraw should almost always only import things from
    @tldraw/tldraw.
    
    - @tldraw/polyfills is merged into @tldraw/editor
    - @tldraw/indices is merged into @tldraw/editor
    - @tldraw/primitives is merged mostly into @tldraw/editor, partially
    into @tldraw/tldraw
    - @tldraw/file-format is merged into @tldraw/tldraw
    - @tldraw/ui is merged into @tldraw/tldraw
    
    Many (many) utils and other code is moved from the editor to tldraw. For
    example, embeds now are entirely an feature of @tldraw/tldraw. The only
    big chunk of code left in core is related to arrow handling.
    
    ## API Changes
    
    The editor can now be used without tldraw's assets. We load them in
    @tldraw/tldraw instead, so feel free to use whatever fonts or images or
    whatever that you like with the editor.
    
    All tools and shapes (except for the `Group` shape) are moved to
    @tldraw/tldraw. This includes the `select` tool.
    
    You should use the editor with at least one tool, however, so you now
    also need to send in an `initialState` prop to the Editor /
    <TldrawEditor> component indicating which state the editor should begin
    in.
    
    The `components` prop now also accepts `SelectionForeground`.
    
    The complex selection component that we use for tldraw is moved to
    @tldraw/tldraw. The default component is quite basic but can easily be
    replaced via the `components` prop. We pass down our tldraw-flavored
    SelectionFg via `components`.
    
    Likewise with the `Scribble` component: the `DefaultScribble` no longer
    uses our freehand tech and is a simple path instead. We pass down the
    tldraw-flavored scribble via `components`.
    
    The `ExternalContentManager` (`Editor.externalContentManager`) is
    removed and replaced with a mapping of types to handlers.
    
    - Register new content handlers with
    `Editor.registerExternalContentHandler`.
    - Register new asset creation handlers (for files and URLs) with
    `Editor.registerExternalAssetHandler`

    Automatic undo/redo (#3364)
    
    Our undo-redo system before this diff is based on commands. A command
    is:
    - A function that produces some data required to perform and undo a
    change
    - A function that actually performs the change, based on the data
    - Another function that undoes the change, based on the data
    - Optionally, a function to _redo_ the change, although in practice we
    never use this
    
    Each command that gets run is added to the undo/redo stack unless it
    says it shouldn't be.
    
    This diff replaces this system of commands with a new one where all
    changes to the store are automatically recorded in the undo/redo stack.
    You can imagine the new history manager like a tape recorder - it
    automatically records everything that happens to the store in a special
    diff, unless you "pause" the recording and ask it not to. Undo and redo
    rewind/fast-forward the tape to certain marks.
    
    As the command concept is gone, the things that were commands are now
    just functions that manipulate the store.
    
    One other change here is that the store's after-phase callbacks (and the
    after-phase side-effects as a result) are now batched up and called at
    the end of certain key operations. For example, `applyDiff` would
    previously call all the `afterCreate` callbacks before making any
    removals from the diff. Now, it (and anything else that uses
    `store.atomic(fn)` will defer firing any after callbacks until the end
    of an operation. before callbacks are still called part-way through
    operations.
    
    ## Design options
    Automatic recording is a fairly large big semantic change, particularly
    to the standalone `store.put`/`store.remove` etc. commands. We could
    instead make not-recording the default, and make recording opt-in
    instead. However, I think auto-record-by-default is the right choice for
    a few reasons:
    
    1. Switching to a recording-based vs command-based undo-redo model is
    fundamentally a big semantic change. In the past, `store.put` etc. were
    always ignored. Now, regardless of whether we choose record-by-default
    or ignore-by-default, the behaviour of `store.put` is _context_
    dependant.
    2. Switching to ignore-by-default means that either our commands don't
    record undo/redo history any more (unless wrapped in
    `editor.history.record`, a far larger semantic change) or they have to
    always-record/all accept a history options bag. If we choose
    always-record, we can't use commands within `history.ignore` as they'll
    start recording again. If we choose the history options bag, we have to
    accept those options in 10s of methods - basically the entire `Editor`
    api surface.
    
    Overall, given that some breaking semantic change here is unavoidable, I
    think that record-by-default hits the right balance of tradeoffs. I
    think it's a better API going forward, whilst also not being too
    disruptive as the APIs it affects are very "deep" ones that we don't
    typically encourage people to use.
    
    
    
    ### Change Type
    
    - [x] `sdk` — Changes the tldraw SDK
    - [x] `improvement` — Improving existing features
    - [x] `galaxy brain` — Architectural changes
    
    ### Release Note
    #### Breaking changes
    ##### 1. History Options
    Previously, some (not all!) commands accepted a history options object
    with `squashing`, `ephemeral`, and `preserveRedoStack` flags. Squashing
    enabled/disabled a memory optimisation (storing individual commands vs
    squashing them together). Ephemeral stopped a command from affecting the
    undo/redo stack at all. Preserve redo stack stopped commands from wiping
    the redo stack. These flags were never available consistently - some
    commands had them and others didn't.
    
    In this version, most of these flags have been removed. `squashing` is
    gone entirely (everything squashes & does so much faster than before).
    There were a couple of commands that had a special default - for
    example, `updateInstanceState` used to default to being `ephemeral`.
    Those maintain the defaults, but the options look a little different now
    - `{ephemeral: true}` is now `{history: 'ignore'}` and
    `{preserveRedoStack: true}` is now `{history:
    'record-preserveRedoStack'}`.
    
    If you were previously using these options in places where they've now
    been removed, you can use wrap them with `editor.history.ignore(fn)` or
    `editor.history.batch(fn, {history: 'record-preserveRedoStack'})`. For
    example,
    ```ts
    editor.nudgeShapes(..., { ephemeral: true })
    ```
    can now be written as
    ```ts
    editor.history.ignore(() => {
        editor.nudgeShapes(...)
    })
    ```
    
    ##### 2. Automatic recording
    Previously, only commands (e.g. `editor.updateShapes` and things that
    use it) were added to the undo/redo stack. Everything else (e.g.
    `editor.store.put`) wasn't. Now, _everything_ that touches the store is
    recorded in the undo/redo stack (unless it's part of
    `mergeRemoteChanges`). You can use `editor.history.ignore(fn)` as above
    if you want to make other changes to the store that aren't recorded -
    this is short for `editor.history.batch(fn, {history: 'ignore'})`
    
    When upgrading to this version of tldraw, you shouldn't need to change
    anything unless you're using `store.put`, `store.remove`, or
    `store.applyDiff` outside of `store.mergeRemoteChanges`. If you are, you
    can preserve the functionality of those not being recorded by wrapping
    them either in `mergeRemoteChanges` (if they're multiplayer-related) or
    `history.ignore` as appropriate.
    
    ##### 3. Side effects
    Before this diff, any changes in side-effects weren't captured by the
    undo-redo stack. This was actually the motivation for this change in the
    first place! But it's a pretty big change, and if you're using side
    effects we recommend you double-check how they interact with undo/redo
    before/after this change. To get the old behaviour back, wrap your side
    effects in `editor.history.ignore`.
    
    ##### 4. Mark options
    Previously, `editor.mark(id)` accepted two additional boolean
    parameters: `onUndo` and `onRedo`. If these were set to false, then when
    undoing or redoing we'd skip over that mark and keep going until we
    found one with those values set to true. We've removed those options -
    if you're using them, let us know and we'll figure out an alternative!

    focus: rework and untangle existing focus management logic in the sdk (#3718)
    
    Focus management is really scattered across the codebase. There's sort
    of a battle between different code paths to make the focus the correct
    desired state. It seemed to grow like a knot and once I started pulling
    on one thread to see if it was still needed you could see underneath
    that it was accounting for another thing underneath that perhaps wasn't
    needed.
    
    The impetus for this PR came but especially during the text label
    rework, now that it's much more easy to jump around from textfield to
    textfield. It became apparent that we were playing whack-a-mole trying
    to preserve the right focus conditions (especially on iOS, ugh).
    
    This tries to remove as many hacks as possible, and bring together in
    place the focus logic (and in the darkness, bind them).
    
    ## Places affected
    - [x] `useEditableText`: was able to remove a bunch of the focus logic
    here. In addition, it doesn't look like we need to save the selection
    range anymore.
    - lingering footgun that needed to be fixed anyway: if there are two
    labels in the same shape, because we were just checking `editingShapeId
    === id`, the two text labels would have just fought each other for
    control
    - [x] `useFocusEvents`: nixed and refactored — we listen to the store in
    `FocusManager` and then take care of autoFocus there
    - [x] `useSafariFocusOutFix`: nixed. not necessary anymore because we're
    not trying to refocus when blurring in `useEditableText`. original PR

    - [x] `defaultSideEffects`: moved logic to `FocusManager`
    - [x] `PointingShape` focus for `startTranslating`, decided to leave
    this alone actually.
    - [x] `TldrawUIButton`: it doesn't look like this focus bug fix is
    needed anymore, original PR for reference:
    https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/2630
    - [x] `useDocumentEvents`: left alone its manual focus after the Escape
    key is hit
    - [x] `FrameHeading`: double focus/select doesn't seem necessary anymore
    - [x] `useCanvasEvents`: `onPointerDown` focus logic never happened b/c
    in `Editor.ts` we `clearedMenus` on pointer down
    - [x] `onTouchStart`: looks like `document.body.click()` is not
    necessary anymore
    
    ## Future Changes
    - [ ] a11y: work on having an accessebility focus ring
    - [ ] Page visibility API:
    (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Page_Visibility_API)
    events when tab is back in focus vs. background, different kind of focus
    - [ ] Reexamine places we manually dispatch `pointer_down` events to see
    if they're necessary.
    - [ ] Minor: get rid of `useContainer` maybe? Is it really necessary to
    have this hook? you can just do `useEditor` → `editor.getContainer()`,
    feels superfluous.
    
    ## Methodology
    Looked for places where we do:
    - `body.click()`
    - places we do `container.focus()`
    - places we do `container.blur()`
    - places we do `editor.updateInstanceState({ isFocused })`
    - places we do `autofocus`
    - searched for `document.activeElement`

    Better generated docs for react components (#3930)
    
    Before:

    React components in docs now list their props, and appear under a new
    "Component" section instead of randomly under either `Function` or
    `Variable`. In order to have our docs generate this, a few criteria need
    to be met:
    1. They need to be tagged with the `@react` tsdoc tag
    2. Their props need to be a simple type alias, typically to an
    interface.
    
    Both of these rules are enforced with a new lint rule - any component
    tagged as `@public` will have these rules enforced.

    Improve page event tracking. (#4202)
    
    Wanted to check how often new pages are created / deleted,... when I
    noticed that we are not tracking many of the page related events. This
    adds the missing event tracking and also renames `new-page` event to
    `move-to-new-page` as it was confusing.

    ### Release notes
    
    - Add additional tracking of page related events like renaming,
    duplicating, moving.
    
    ### Breaking change
    `new-page` action was renamed to `move-to-new-page`.

    Deprecate editor.mark, fix cropping tests (#4250)
    
    So it turns out `editor.mark(id)` is a bit problematic unless you always
    pass in unique id, because it's quite easy to create situations where
    you will call `bailToMark(id)` but the mark that you were _intending_ to
    bail to has already been popped off the stack due to another previous
    call to `bailToMark`.
    
    I always suspected this might be the case (the original late 2022
    history api was designed to avoid this, but it got changed at some
    point) and indeed I ran into this bug while investigating a cropping
    undo/redo test error.
    
    To prevent issues for ourselves and our users, let's force people to use
    a randomly generated mark ID.
    
    Also `editor.mark` is a bad name. `mark` could mean a million things,
    even in the context of `editor.history.mark` it's a pretty bad name.
    Let's help people out and make it more descriptive.
    
    This PR deprecates the `editor.mark(id)` in favor of `id =
    editor.markHistoryStoppingPoint(name)`.
    
    I converted a couple of usages of editor.mark over but there's a lot
    left to do so I only want to do it if you don't object @steveruizok

    ### Release notes
    
    This deprecates `Editor.mark()` in favour of
    `Editor.markHistoryStoppingPoint()`.
    
    This was done because calling `editor.mark(id)` is a potential footgun
    unless you always provide a random ID. So
    `editor.markHistoryStoppingPoint()` always returns a random id.

    Fix an issue with canceling the page name and presence name changes. (#4408)
    
    You can now use escape to cancel the changes to page name and presence
    name changes.
    
    There was an issue with using Escape to cancel the page name or presence
    name changes. The problem was that Escape key event (on key down) was
    captured by the popover component (radix) which closed the popover. This
    meant that the `onKeyUp` in `TldrawUiInput` never triggered when Escape
    was pressed so the `onCancel` callback was never called.
    We now prevent the direct closing of the popover on Escape which means
    that we do have to close it manually.
    
    Could maybe also cause the `onCancel` to be called on key down, might be
    better?
