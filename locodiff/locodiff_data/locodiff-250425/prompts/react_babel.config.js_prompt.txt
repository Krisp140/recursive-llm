# Instructions

You are being benchmarked. You will see the output of a git log command, and from that must infer the current state of a file. Think carefully, as you must output the exact state of the file to earn full marks.

**Important:** Your goal is to reproduce the file's content *exactly* as it exists at the final commit, even if the code appears broken, buggy, or contains obvious errors. Do **not** try to "fix" the code. Attempting to correct issues will result in a poor score, as this benchmark evaluates your ability to reproduce the precise state of the file based on its history.

# Required Response Format

Wrap the content of the file in triple backticks (```). Any text outside the final closing backticks will be ignored. End your response after outputting the closing backticks.

# Example Response

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
print('Hello, world!')
```

# File History

> git log -p --cc --topo-order --reverse -- babel.config.js

    Babel 7 (#16297)
    
    Upgraded from Babel 6 to Babel 7.
    
    The only significant change seems to be the way `@babel/plugin-transform-classes` handles classes differently from `babel-plugin-transform-es2015-classes`. In regular mode, the former injects a `_createClass` function that increases the bundle size, and in the latter it removes the safeguard checks. However, this is okay because we don't all classes in new features, and we want to deprecate class usage in the future in the react repo.

commit 952aa74f8e45ed35ac6bf1de10ad5ed5410deac6

    Upgrade tests to use react/jsx-runtime (#28252)
    
    Instead of createElement.
    
    We should have done this when we initially released jsx-runtime but
    better late than never. The general principle is that our tests should
    be written using the most up-to-date idioms that we recommend for users,
    except when explicitly testing an edge case or legacy behavior, like for
    backwards compatibility.
    
    Most of the diff is related to tweaking test output and isn't very
    interesting.
    
    I did have to workaround an issue related to component stacks. The
    component stack logic depends on shared state that lives in the React
    module. The problem is that most of our tests reset the React module
    state and re-require a fresh instance of React, React DOM, etc. However,
    the JSX runtime is not re-required because it's injected by the compiler
    as a static import. This means its copy of the shared state is no longer
    the same as the one used by React, causing any warning logged by the JSX
    runtime to not include a component stack. (This same issue also breaks
    string refs, but since we're removing those soon I'm not so concerned
    about that.) The solution I went with for now is to mock the JSX runtime
    with a proxy that re-requires the module on every function invocation. I
    don't love this but it will have to do for now. What we should really do
    is migrate our tests away from manually resetting the module state and
    use import syntax instead.

    Partially revert #32588 (#32621)
    
    https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/32588 changed the babel config
    impacting local tests, and I'm not able to run test:
    
    <img width="1354" alt="Screenshot 2025-03-15 at 2 37 00 PM"
    src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d4afe39-6ab6-4c83-87a9-ceb0ee5f8df5"
    />
    
    
    This PR reverts those changes until we can re-land with a fix.
