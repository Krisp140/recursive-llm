# Instructions

You are being benchmarked. You will see the output of a git log command, and from that must infer the current state of a file. Think carefully, as you must output the exact state of the file to earn full marks.

**Important:** Your goal is to reproduce the file's content *exactly* as it exists at the final commit, even if the code appears broken, buggy, or contains obvious errors. Do **not** try to "fix" the code. Attempting to correct issues will result in a poor score, as this benchmark evaluates your ability to reproduce the precise state of the file based on its history.

# Required Response Format

Wrap the content of the file in triple backticks (```). Any text outside the final closing backticks will be ignored. End your response after outputting the closing backticks.

# Example Response

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
print('Hello, world!')
```

commit 115cd12d9bbb2bff303e52feb1394e3a2cef20ca
Author: Andrew Clark <git@andrewclark.io>
Date:   Fri Mar 6 09:29:05 2020 -0800

    Add test run that uses www feature flags (#18234)
    
    In CI, we run our test suite against multiple build configurations. For
    example, we run our tests in both dev and prod, and in both the
    experimental and stable release channels. This is to prevent accidental
    deviations in behavior between the different builds. If there's an
    intentional deviation in behavior, the test author must account
    for them.
    
    However, we currently don't run tests against the www builds. That's
    a problem, because it's common for features to land in www before they
    land anywhere else, including the experimental release channel.
    Typically we do this so we can gradually roll out the feature behind
    a flag before deciding to enable it.
    
    The way we test those features today is by mutating the
    `shared/ReactFeatureFlags` module. There are a few downsides to this
    approach, though. The flag is only overridden for the specific tests or
    test suites where you apply the override. But usually what you want is
    to run *all* tests with the flag enabled, to protect against unexpected
    regressions.
    
    Also, mutating the feature flags module only works when running the
    tests against source, not against the final build artifacts, because the
    ReactFeatureFlags module is inlined by the build script.
    
    Instead, we should run the test suite against the www configuration,
    just like we do for prod, experimental, and so on. I've added a new
    command, `yarn test-www`. It automatically runs in CI.
    
    Some of the www feature flags are dynamic; that is, they depend on
    a runtime condition (i.e. a GK). These flags are imported from an
    external module that lives in www. Those flags will be enabled for some
    clients and disabled for others, so we should run the tests against
    *both* modes.
    
    So I've added a new global `__VARIANT__`, and a new test command `yarn
    test-www-variant`. `__VARIANT__` is set to false by default; when
    running `test-www-variant`, it's set to true.
    
    If we were going for *really* comprehensive coverage, we would run the
    tests against every possible configuration of feature flags: 2 ^
    numberOfFlags total combinations. That's not practical, though, so
    instead we only run against two combinations: once with `__VARIANT__`
    set to `true`, and once with it set to `false`. We generally assume that
    flags can be toggled independently, so in practice this should
    be enough.
    
    You can also refer to `__VARIANT__` in tests to detect which mode you're
    running in. Or, you can import `shared/ReactFeatureFlags` and read the
    specific flag you can about. However, we should stop mutating that
    module going forward. Treat it as read-only.
    
    In this commit, I have only setup the www tests to run against source.
    I'll leave running against build for a follow up.
    
    Many of our tests currently assume they run only in the default
    configuration, and break when certain flags are toggled. Rather than fix
    these all up front, I've hard-coded the relevant flags to the default
    values. We can incrementally migrate those tests later.

    Refactor Component Stack Traces (#18495)
    
    * Add feature flag
    
    * Split stack from current fiber
    
    You can get stack from any fiber, not just current.
    
    * Refactor description of component frames
    
    These should use fiber tags for switching. This also puts the relevant code
    behind DEV flags.
    
    * We no longer expose StrictMode in component stacks
    
    They're not super useful and will go away later anyway.
    
    * Update tests
    
    Context is no longer part of SSR stacks. This was already the case on the
    client.
    
    forwardRef no longer is wrapped on the stack. It's still in getComponentName
    but it's probably just noise in stacks. Eventually we'll remove the wrapper
    so it'll go away anyway. If we use native stack frames they won't have this
    extra wrapper.
    
    It also doesn't pick up displayName from the outer wrapper. We could maybe
    transfer it but this will also be fixed by removing the wrapper.
    
    * Forward displayName onto the inner function for forwardRef and memo in DEV
    
    This allows them to show up in stack traces.
    
    I'm not doing this for lazy because lazy is supposed to be called on the
    consuming side so you shouldn't assign it a name on that end. Especially
    not one that mutates the inner.
    
    * Use multiple instances of the fake component
    
    We mutate the inner component for its name so we need multiple copies.

    Put render phase update change behind a flag (#18850)
    
    In the new reconciler, I made a change to how render phase updates
    work. (By render phase updates, I mean when a component updates
    another component during its render phase. Or when a class component
    updates itself during the render phase. It does not include when
    a hook updates its own component during the render phase. Those have
    their own semantics. So really I mean anything triggers the "`setState`
    in render" warning.)
    
    The old behavior is to give the update the same "thread" (expiration
    time) as whatever is currently rendering. So if you call `setState` on a
    component that happens later in the same render, it will flush during
    that render. Ideally, we want to remove the special case and treat them
    as if they came from an interleaved event.
    
    Regardless, this pattern is not officially supported. This behavior is
    only a fallback. The flag only exists until we can roll out the
    `setState` warnning, since existing code might accidentally rely on the
    current behavior.

    Expose LegacyHidden type and disable <div hidden /> API in new fork (#18891)
    
    * Expose LegacyHidden type
    
    I will use this internally at Facebook to migrate away from
    <div hidden />. The end goal is to migrate to the Offscreen type, but
    that has different semantics. This is an incremental step.
    
    * Disable <div hidden /> API in new fork
    
    Migrates to the unstable_LegacyHidden type instead. The old fork does
    not support the new component type, so I updated the tests to use an
    indirection that picks the correct API. I will remove this once the
    LegacyHidden (and/or Offscreen) type has landed in both implementations.
    
    * Add gated warning for `<div hidden />` API

    Disable <div hidden /> API in old fork, too (#18917)
    
    The motivation for doing this is to make it impossible for additional
    uses of pre-rendering to sneak into www without going through the
    LegacyHidden abstraction. Since this feature was already disabled in
    the new fork, this brings the two closer to parity.
    
    The LegacyHidden abstraction itself still needs to opt into
    pre-rendering somehow, so rather than totally disabling the feature, I
    updated the `hidden` prop check to be obnoxiously specific. Before, you
    could set it to any truthy value; now, you must set it to the string
    "unstable-do-not-use-legacy-hidden".
    
    The node will still be hidden in the DOM, since any truthy value will
    cause the browser to apply a style of `display: none`.
    
    I will have to update the LegacyHidden component in www to use the
    obnoxious string prop. This doesn't block merge, though, since the
    behavior is gated by a dynamic flag. I will update the component before
    I enable the flag.

    Add user timing marks for scheduling profiler tool (#19223)
    
    High level breakdown of this commit:
    
    * Add a enableSchedulingProfiling feature flag.
    * Add functions that call User Timing APIs to a new SchedulingProfiler file. The file follows DebugTracing's structure.
    * Add user timing marks to places where DebugTracing logs.
    * Add user timing marks to most other places where @bvaughn's original draft DebugTracing branch marks.
    * Tests added
    * More context (and discussions with @bvaughn) available at our internal PR MLH-Fellowship#11 and issue MLH-Fellowship#5.
    
    Similar to DebugTracing, we've only added scheduling profiling calls to the old reconciler fork.

    Permanently removed component stacks from scheduling profiler data (#19615)
    
    These stacks improve the profiler data but they're expensive to generate and generating them can also cause runtime errors in larger applications (although an exact repro has been hard to nail down). Removing them for now. We can revisit adding them after this profiler has been integrated into the DevTools extension and we can generate them lazily.

    Always skip unmounted/unmounting error boundaries (#19627)
    
    The behavior of error boundaries for passive effects that throw during cleanup was recently changed so that React ignores boundaries which are also unmounting in favor of still-mounted boundaries. This commit implements that same behavior for layout effects (useLayoutEffect, componentWillUnmount, and ref-detachment).
    
    The new, skip-unmounting-boundaries behavior is behind a feature flag (`skipUnmountedBoundaries`).

    Attach Listeners Eagerly to Roots and Portal Containers (#19659)
    
    * Failing test for #19608
    
    * Attach Listeners Eagerly to Roots and Portal Containers
    
    * Forbid createEventHandle with custom events
    
    We can't support this without adding more complexity. It's not clear that this is even desirable, as none of our existing use cases need custom events. This API primarily exists as a deprecation strategy for Flare, so I don't think it is important to expand its support beyond what Flare replacement code currently needs. We can later revisit it with a better understanding of the eager/lazy tradeoff but for now let's remove the inconsistency.
    
    * Reduce risk by changing condition only under the flag

    offscreen double invoke effects (#19523)
    
    This PR double invokes effects in __DEV__ mode.
    
    We are thinking about unmounting layout and/or passive effects for a hidden tree. To understand potential issues with this, we want to double invoke effects. This PR changes the behavior in DEV when an effect runs from create() to create() -> destroy() -> create(). The effect cleanup function will still be called before the effect runs in both dev and prod. (Note: This change is purely for research for now as it is likely to break real code.)
    
    **Note: The change is fully behind a flag and does not affect any of the code on npm.**

    useRef: Warn about reading or writing mutable values during render (#18545)
    
    Reading or writing a ref value during render is only safe if you are implementing the lazy initialization pattern.
    
    Other types of reading are unsafe as the ref is a mutable source.
    
    Other types of writing are unsafe as they are effectively side effects.
    
    This change also refactors useTransition to no longer use a ref hook, but instead manage its own (stable) hook state.

    Add disableNativeComponentFrames flag (#20364)
    
    ## Summary
    
    We're experiencing some issues internally where the component stack is
    getting into our way of fixing them as it causes the page to become
    unresponsive. This adds a flag so that we can disable this feature as a
    temporary workaround.
    
    More internal context: https://fburl.com/go9yoklm
    
    ## Test Plan
    
    I tried to default this flag to `__VARIANT__` but the variant tests
    (`yarn test-www --variant`) started to fail across the board since a lot
    of tests depend on the component tree, things like this:
    
    https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/458591/100771192-6a1e1c00-33fe-11eb-9ab0-8ff46ba378a2.png
    
    So, it seems to work :-)
    
    Given that it's unhandy to update the hundreds of tests that are failing
    I decided to hard code this to `false` like we already do for some other
    options.

    Improve error boundary handling for unmounted subtrees (#20645)
    
    A passive effect's cleanup function may throw after an unmount. Prior to this commit, such an error would be ignored. (React would not notify any error boundaries.)
    
    After this commit, React will skip any unmounted boundaries and look for a still-mounted boundary. If one is found, it will call getDerivedStateFromError and/or componentDidCatch (depending on the type of boundary). Unmounted boundaries will be ignored, but as they have been unmounted– this seems appropriate.

    Experiment: Unsuspend all lanes on update (#20660)
    
    Adds a feature flag to tweak the internal heuristic used to "unsuspend"
    lanes when a new update comes in.
    
    A lane is "suspended" if we couldn't finish rendering it because it was
    missing data, and we chose not to commit the fallback. (In this context,
    "suspended" does not include updates that finished with a fallback.)
    
    When we receive new data in the form of an update, we need to retry
    rendering the suspended lanes, since the new data may have unblocked the
    previously suspended work. For example, the new update could navigate
    back to an already loaded route.
    
    It's impractical to retry every combination of suspended lanes, so we
    need some heuristic that decides which lanes to retry and in
    which order.
    
    The existing heuristic roughly approximates the old Expiration Times
    model. It unsuspends all lower priority lanes, but leaves higher
    priority lanes suspended.
    
    Then when we start rendering, we choose the lanes that have the highest
    LanePriority and render those -- and then we add to that all the lanes
    that are highher priority.
    
    If this sounds terribly confusing, it's because it barely makes sense.
    (It made more sense in the Expiration Times world, I promise, but it
    was still confusing.) I don't think it's worth me trying to explain the
    old behavior too much because the point here is that we can replace it
    with something simpler.
    
    The new heurstic is to unsuspend all suspended lanes whenever there's
    an update.
    
    This is effectively what we already do except in a few very specific
    edge cases, ever since we removed the delayed suspense feature from
    everything that's not a refresh transition.
    
    We can optimize this in the future to only unsuspend lanes that are
    either 1) in the `lanes` or `subtreeLanes` of the node that was updated,
    or 2) in the `lanes` of the return path of the node that was updated.
    This would exclude lanes that are only located in unrelated sibling
    trees. But, this optimization wouldn't be useful currently because we
    assign the same transition lane to all transitions. It will become
    relevant again once we start assigning arbitrary lanes to transitions
    -- but that in turn requires us to implement entanglement of overlapping
    transitions, one of our planned projects.
    
    So to sum up: the goal here is to remove the weird edge cases and switch
    to a simpler model, on top of which we can make more substantial
    improvements.
    
    I put it behind a flag so I can run an A/B test and confirm it doesn't
    cause a regression.

    Default updates should not interrupt transitions (#20771)
    
    The only difference between default updates and transition updates is
    that default updates do not support suspended refreshes — they will
    instantly display a fallback.

    Add StrictMode level prop and createRoot unstable_strictModeLevel option (#20849)
    
    * The exported '<React.StrictMode>' tag remains the same and opts legacy subtrees into strict mode level one ('mode == StrictModeL1'). This mode enables DEV-only double rendering, double component lifecycles, string ref warnings, legacy context warnings, etc. The primary purpose of this mode is to help detected render phase side effects. No new behavior. Roots created with experimental 'createRoot' and 'createBlockingRoot' APIs will also (for now) continue to default to strict mode level 1.
    
    In a subsequent commit I will add support for a 'level' attribute on the '<React.StrictMode>' tag (as well as a new option supported by ). This will be the way to opt into strict mode level 2 ('mode == StrictModeL2'). This mode will enable DEV-only double invoking of effects on initial mount. This will simulate future Offscreen API semantics for trees being mounted, then hidden, and then shown again. The primary purpose of this mode is to enable applications to prepare for compatibility with the new Offscreen API (more information to follow shortly).
    
    For now, this commit changes no public facing behavior. The only mechanism for opting into strict mode level 2 is the pre-existing 'enableDoubleInvokingEffects' feature flag (only enabled within Facebook for now).
    
    * Renamed strict mode constants
    
    StrictModeL1 -> StrictLegacyMode and StrictModeL2 -> StrictEffectsMode
    
    * Renamed tests
    
    * Split strict effects mode into two flags
    
    One flag ('enableStrictEffects') enables strict mode level 2. It is similar to 'debugRenderPhaseSideEffectsForStrictMode' which enables srtict mode level 1.
    
    The second flag ('createRootStrictEffectsByDefault') controls the default strict mode level for 'createRoot' trees. For now, all 'createRoot' trees remain level 1 by default. We will experiment with level 2 within Facebook.
    
    This is a prerequisite for adding a configurable option to 'createRoot' that enables choosing a different StrictMode level than the default.
    
    * Add StrictMode 'unstable_level' prop and createRoot 'unstable_strictModeLevel' option
    
    New StrictMode 'unstable_level' prop allows specifying which level of strict mode to use. If no level attribute is specified, StrictLegacyMode will be used to maintain backwards compatibility. Otherwise the following is true:
    * Level 0 does nothing
    * Level 1 selects StrictLegacyMode
    * Level 2 selects StrictEffectsMode (which includes StrictLegacyMode)
    
    Levels can be increased with nesting (0 -> 1 -> 2) but not decreased.
    
    This commit also adds a new 'unstable_strictModeLevel' option to the createRoot and createBatchedRoot APIs. This option can be used to override default behavior to increase or decrease the StrictMode level of the root.
    
    A subsequent commit will add additional DEV warnings:
    * If a nested StrictMode tag attempts to explicitly decrease the level
    * If a level attribute changes in an update

    Move context comparison to consumer
    
    In the lazy context implementation, not all context changes are
    propagated from the provider, so we can't rely on the propagation alone
    to mark the consumer as dirty. The consumer needs to compare to the
    previous value, like we do for state and context.
    
    I added a `memoizedValue` field to the context dependency type. Then in
    the consumer, we iterate over the current dependencies to see if
    something changed. We only do this iteration after props and state has
    already bailed out, so it's a relatively uncommon path, except at the
    root of a changed subtree. Alternatively, we could move these
    comparisons into `readContext`, but that's a much hotter path, so I
    think this is an appropriate trade off.

    [Experiment] Add feature flag for more aggressive memory clean-up of deleted fiber trees (#21039)
    
    * Add feature flag: enableStrongMemoryCleanup
    
    Add a feature flag that will test doing a recursive clean of an unmount
    node. This will disconnect the fiber graph making leaks less severe.
    
    * Detach sibling pointers in old child list
    
    When a fiber is deleted, it's still part of the previous (alternate)
    parent fiber's list of children. Because children are a linked list, an
    earlier sibling that's still alive will be connected to the deleted
    fiber via its alternate:
    
    
      live fiber
      --alternate--> previous live fiber
      --sibling--> deleted fiber
    
    We can't disconnect `alternate` on nodes that haven't been deleted
    yet, but we can disconnect the `sibling` and `child` pointers.
    
    Will use this feature flag to test the memory impact.
    
    * Combine into single enum flag
    
    I combined `enableStrongMemoryCleanup` and `enableDetachOldChildList`
    into a single enum flag. The flag has three possible values. Each level
    is a superset of the previous one and performs more aggressive clean up.
    
    We will use this to compare the memory impact of each level.
    
    * Add Flow type to new host config method
    
    * Re-use existing recursive clean up path
    
    We already have a recursive loop that visits every deleted fiber. We
    can re-use that one for clean up instead of adding another one.

    Proposed new Suspense layout effect semantics (#21079)
    
    This commit contains a proposed change to layout effect semantics within Suspense subtrees: If a component mounts within a Suspense boundary and is later hidden (because of something else suspending) React will cleanup that component’s layout effects (including React-managed refs).
    
    This change will hopefully fix existing bugs that occur because of things like reading layout in a hidden tree and will also enable a point at which to e.g. pause videos and hide user-managed portals. After the suspended boundary resolves, React will setup the component’s layout effects again (including React-managed refs).
    
    The scenario described above is not common. The useTransition API should ensure that Suspense does not revert to its fallback state after being mounted.
    
    Note that these changes are primarily written in terms of the (as of yet internal) Offscreen API as we intend to provide similar effects semantics within recently shown/hidden Offscreen trees in the future. (More to follow.)
    
    (Note that all changes in this PR are behind a new feature flag, enableSuspenseLayoutEffectSemantics, which is disabled for now.)

    Track which fibers scheduled the current render work (#15658)
    
    Tracked Fibers are called "updaters" and are exposed to DevTools via a 'memoizedUpdaters' property on the ReactFiberRoot. The implementation of this feature follows a vaguely similar approach as interaction tracing, but does not require reference counting since there is no subscriptions API.
    
    This change is in support of a new DevTools Profiler feature that shows which Fiber(s) scheduled the selected commit in the Profiler.
    
    All changes have been gated behind a new feature flag, 'enableUpdaterTracking', which is enabled for Profiling builds by default. We also only track updaters when DevTools has been detected, to avoid doing unnecessary work.

    Re-add old Fabric Offscreen impl behind flag (#22018)
    
    * Re-add old Fabric Offscreen impl behind flag
    
    There's a chance that #21960 will affect layout in a way that we don't
    expect, so I'm adding back the old implementation so we can toggle the
    feature with a flag.
    
    The flag should read from the ReactNativeFeatureFlags shim so that we
    can change it at runtime. I'll do that separately.
    
    * Import dynamic RN flags from external module
    
    Internal feature flags that we wish to control with a GK can now be
    imported from an external module, which I've called
    "ReactNativeInternalFeatureFlags".
    
    We'll need to add this module to the downstream repo.
    
    We can't yet use this in our tests, because we don't have a test
    configuration that runs against the React Native feature flags fork. We
    should set up that up the same way we did for www.

    [DevTools][Transition Tracing] onTransitionComplete and onTransitionStart implmentation (#23313)
    
    * add transition name to startTransition
    
    Add a transitionName to start transition, store the transition start time and name in the batch config, and pass it to the root on render
    
    * Transition Tracing Types and Consts
    
    * Root begin work
    
    The root operates as a tracing marker that has all transitions on it. This PR only tested the root with one transition so far
    
    - Store transitions in memoizedState. Do this in updateHostRoot AND attemptEarlyBailoutIfNoScheduledUpdate. We need to do this in the latter part because even if the root itself doesn't have an update, it could still have new transitions in its transitionLanes map that we need to process.
    
    * Transition Tracing commit phase
    
    - adds a module scoped pending transition callbacks object that contains all transition callbacks that have not yet been processed. This  contains all callbacks before the next paint occurs.
    - Add code in the mutation phase to:
            * For the root, if there are transitions that were initialized during this commit in the root transition lanes map, add a transition start call to the pending transition callbacks object. Then, remove the transitions from the root transition lanes map.
            * For roots, in the commit phase, add a transition complete call
    
    We add this code in the mutation phase because we can't add it to the passive phase because then the paint might have occurred before we even know which callbacks to call
    
    * Process Callbacks after paint
    
    At the end of the commit phase, call scheduleTransitionCallbacks to schedule all pending transition callbacks to be called after paint. Then clear the callbacks

    There are a few internal tests that still need to be updated, so I'm
    adding this flag back for www only.
    
    The desired behavior rolled out to 10% public, so we're confident there
    are no issues.
    
    The open source behavior remains (skipUnmountedBoundaries = true).

    Revert "Land enableClientRenderFallbackOnTextMismatch" (#24738)
    
    This reverts commit 327e4a1f96fbb874001b17684fbb073046a84938.
    
    Turns out we hadn't rolled this out internally yet — I mistook
    enableClientRenderFallbackOnHydrationMismatch for
    said enableClientRenderFallbackOnTextMismatch. Need to revert
    until we finish rolling out the change.

    Implement basic stylesheet Resources for react-dom (#25060)
    
    Implement basic support for "Resources". In the context of this commit, the only thing that is currently a Resource are
    
    <link rel="stylesheet" precedence="some-value" ...>
    
    Resources can be rendered anywhere in the react tree, even outside of normal parenting rules, for instance you can render a resource before you have rendered the <html><head> tags for your application. In the stream we reorder this so the browser always receives valid HTML and resources are emitted either in place (normal circumstances) or at the top of the <head> (when you render them above or before the <head> in your react tree)
    
    On the client, resources opt into an entirely different hydration path. Instead of matching the location within the Document these resources are queried for in the entire document. It is an error to have more than one resource with the same href attribute.
    
    The use of precedence here as an opt-in signal for resourcifying the link is in preparation for a more complete Resource implementation which will dedupe resource references (multiple will be valid), hoist to the appropriate container (body, head, or elsewhere), order (according to precedence) and Suspend boundaries that depend on them. More details will come in the coming weeks on this plan.
    
    This feature is gated by an experimental flag and will only be made available in experimental builds until some future time.

    Batch sync, default and continuous lanes (#25700)
    
    <!--
      Thanks for submitting a pull request!
    We appreciate you spending the time to work on these changes. Please
    provide enough information so that others can review your pull request.
    The three fields below are mandatory.
    
    Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is
    done:
    
    1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create
    your branch from `main`.
      2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.
    3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!
    4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch
    TestName` is helpful in development.
    5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It
    supports the same options as `yarn test`.
    6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn debug-test --watch TestName`, open
    `chrome://inspect`, and press "Inspect".
    7. Format your code with
    [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).
    8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only
    check changed files.
      9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type checks (`yarn flow`).
      10. If you haven't already, complete the CLA.

    ## Summary
    
    <!--
    Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem
    does the pull request solve?
    -->
    This is the other approach for unifying default and sync lane
    https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/25524.
    The approach in that PR is to merge default and continuous lane into the
    sync lane, and use a new field to track the priority. But there are a
    couple places that field will be needed, and it is difficult to
    correctly reset the field when there is no sync lane.
    
    In this PR we take the other approach that doesn't remove any lane, but
    batch them to get the behavior we want.
    
    
    ## How did you test this change?
    
    <!--
    Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and
    their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user
    interface.
    How exactly did you verify that your PR solves the issue you wanted to
    solve?
      If you leave this empty, your PR will very likely be closed.

    [trusted types][www] Add enableTrustedTypesIntegration flag back in (#26016)
    
    ## Summary
    
    The flag was first added in #16157 and was rolled out to employees in
    D17430095. #25997 removed this flag because it wasn't dynamically set to
    a value in www. The www side was mistakenly removed in D41851685 due to
    deprecation of a TypedJSModule but we still want to keep this flag, so
    let's add it back in + add a GK on the www side to match the previous
    rollout.
    
    See D42574435 for the dynamic value change in www
    
    ## How did you test this change?
    
    ```
    yarn test
    yarn test --prod

    `prettier` and `rollup-plugin-prettier` to the latest versions.
    
    I added the prettier config `arrowParens: "avoid"` to reduce the diff
    size as the default has changed in Prettier 2.0. The largest amount of
    changes comes from function expressions now having a space. This doesn't
    have an option to preserve the old behavior, so we have to update this.

    Don't prerender siblings of suspended component  (#26380)
    
    Today if something suspends, React will continue rendering the siblings
    of that component.
    
    Our original rationale for prerendering the siblings of a suspended
    component was to initiate any lazy fetches that they might contain. This
    was when we were more bullish about lazy fetching being a good idea some
    of the time (when combined with prefetching), as opposed to our latest
    thinking, which is that it's almost always a bad idea.
    
    Another rationale for the original behavior was that the render was I/O
    bound, anyway, so we might as do some extra work in the meantime. But
    this was before we had the concept of instant loading states: when
    navigating to a new screen, it's better to show a loading state as soon
    as you can (often a skeleton UI), rather than delay the transition.
    (There are still cases where we block the render, when a suitable
    loading state is not available; it's just not _all_ cases where
    something suspends.) So the biggest issue with our existing
    implementation is that the prerendering of the siblings happens within
    the same render pass as the one that suspended — _before_ the loading
    state appears.
    
    What we should do instead is immediately unwind the stack as soon as
    something suspends, to unblock the loading state.
    
    If we want to preserve the ability to prerender the siblings, what we
    could do is schedule special render pass immediately after the fallback
    is displayed. This is likely what we'll do in the future. However, in
    the new implementation of `use`, there's another reason we don't
    prerender siblings: so we can preserve the state of the stack when
    something suspends, and resume where we left of when the promise
    resolves without replaying the parents. The only way to do this
    currently is to suspend the entire work loop. Fiber does not currently
    support rendering multiple siblings in "parallel". Once you move onto
    the next sibling, the stack of the previous sibling is discarded and
    cannot be restored. We do plan to implement this feature, but it will
    require a not-insignificant refactor.
    
    Given that lazy data fetching is already bad for performance, the best
    trade off for now seems to be to disable prerendering of siblings. This
    gives us the best performance characteristics when you're following best
    practices (i.e. hoist data fetches to Server Components or route
    loaders), at the expense of making an already bad pattern a bit worse.
    
    Later, when we implement resumable context stacks, we can reenable
    sibling prerendering. Though even then the use case will mostly be to
    prerender the CPU-bound work, not lazy fetches.

    Move update scheduling to microtask (#26512)
    
    When React receives new input (via `setState`, a Suspense promise
    resolution, and so on), it needs to ensure there's a rendering task
    associated with the update. Most of this happens
    `ensureRootIsScheduled`.
    
    If a single event contains multiple updates, we end up running the
    scheduling code once per update. But this is wasteful because we really
    only need to run it once, at the end of the event (or in the case of
    flushSync, at the end of the scope function's execution).
    
    So this PR moves the scheduling logic to happen in a microtask instead.
    In some cases, we will force it run earlier than that, like for
    `flushSync`, but since updates are batched by default, it will almost
    always happen in the microtask. Even for discrete updates.
    
    In production, this should have no observable behavior difference. In a
    testing environment that uses `act`, this should also not have a
    behavior difference because React will push these tasks to an internal
    `act` queue.
    
    However, tests that do not use `act` and do not simulate an actual
    production environment (like an e2e test) may be affected. For example,
    before this change, if a test were to call `setState` outside of `act`
    and then immediately call `jest.runAllTimers()`, the update would be
    synchronously applied. After this change, that will no longer work
    because the rendering task (a timer, in this case) isn't scheduled until
    after the microtask queue has run.
    
    I don't expect this to be an issue in practice because most people do
    not write their tests this way. They either use `act`, or they write
    e2e-style tests.
    
    The biggest exception has been... our own internal test suite. Until
    recently, many of our tests were written in a way that accidentally
    relied on the updates being scheduled synchronously. Over the past few
    weeks, @tyao1 and I have gradually converted the test suite to use a new
    set of testing helpers that are resilient to this implementation detail.
    
    (There are also some old Relay tests that were written in the style of
    React's internal test suite. Those will need to be fixed, too.)
    
    The larger motivation behind this change, aside from a minor performance
    improvement, is we intend to use this new microtask to perform
    additional logic that doesn't yet exist. Like inferring the priority of
    a custom event.

    Diff properties in the commit phase instead of generating an update payload (#26583)
    
    This removes the concept of `prepareUpdate()`, behind a flag.
    
    React Native already does everything in the commit phase, but generates
    a temporary update payload before applying it.
    
    React Fabric does it both in the render phase. Now it just moves it to a
    single host config.
    
    For DOM I forked updateProperties into one that does diffing and
    updating in one pass vs just applying a pre-diffed updatePayload.
    
    There are a few downsides of this approach:
    
    - If only "children" has changed, we end up scheduling an update to be
    done in the commit phase. Since we traverse through it anyway, it's
    probably not much extra.
    - It does more work in the commit phase so for a large tree that is
    mostly unchanged, it'll stall longer.
    - It does some extra work for special cases since that work happens if
    anything has changed. We no longer have a deep bailout.
    - The special cases now have to each replicate the "clean up old props"
    loop, leading to extra code.
    
    The benefit is that this doesn't allocate temporary extra objects
    (possibly multiple per element if the array has to resize). It's less
    work overall. It also gives us an option to reuse this function for a
    sync render optimization.
    
    Another benefit is that if we do the loop in the commit phase I can do
    further optimizations by reading all props that I need for special cases
    in that loop instead of polymorphic reads from props. This is what I'd
    like to do in future refactors that would be stacked on top of this
    change.

    Initial (client-only) async actions support (#26621)
    
    Implements initial (client-only) support for async actions behind a
    flag. This is an experimental feature and the design isn't completely
    finalized but we're getting closer. It will be layered alongside other
    features we're working on, so it may not feel complete when considered
    in isolation.
    
    The basic description is you can pass an async function to
    `startTransition` and all the transition updates that are scheduled
    inside that async function will be grouped together. The `isPending`
    flag will be set to true immediately, and only set back to false once
    the async action has completed (as well as all the updates that it
    triggers).
    
    The ideal behavior would be that all updates spawned by the async action
    are automatically inferred and grouped together; however, doing this
    properly requires the upcoming (stage 2) Async Context API, which is not
    yet implemented by browsers. In the meantime, we will fake this by
    grouping together all transition updates that occur until the async
    function has terminated. This can lead to overgrouping between unrelated
    actions, which is not wrong per se, just not ideal.
    
    If the `useTransition` hook is removed from the UI before an async
    action has completed — for example, if the user navigates to a new page
    — subsequent transitions will no longer be grouped with together with
    that action.
    
    Another consequence of the lack of Async Context is that if you call
    `setState` inside an action but after an `await`, it must be wrapped in
    `startTransition` in order to be grouped properly. If we didn't require
    this, then there would be no way to distinguish action updates from
    urgent updates caused by user input, too. This is an unfortunate footgun
    but we can likely detect the most common mistakes using a lint rule.
    
    Once Async Context lands in browsers, we can start warning in dev if we
    detect an update that hasn't been wrapped in `startTransition`. Then,
    longer term, once the feature is ubiquitous, we can rely on it for real
    and allow you to call `setState` without the additional wrapper.
    
    Things that are _not_ yet implemented in this PR, but will be added as
    follow ups:
    
    - Support for non-hook form of `startTransition`
    - Canceling the async action scope if the `useTransition` hook is
    deleted from the UI
    - Anything related to server actions

    Add `alwaysThrottleRetries` flag (#26685)
    
    This puts the change introduced by #26611 behind a flag until Meta is
    able to roll it out. Disabling the flag reverts back to the old
    behavior, where retries are throttled if there's still data remaining in
    the tree, but not if all the data has finished loading.
    
    The new behavior is still enabled in the public builds.

    Clean up enableSyncDefaultUpdates flag a bit (#26858)
    
    ## Overview
    
    Does a few things:
    - Renames `enableSyncDefaultUpdates` to
    `forceConcurrentByDefaultForTesting`
    - Changes the way it's used so it's dead-code eliminated separate from
    `allowConcurrentByDefault`
    - Deletes a bunch of the gated code
    
    The gates that are deleted are unnecessary now. We were keeping them
    when we originally thought we would come back to being concurrent by
    default. But we've shifted and now sync-by default is the desired
    behavior long term, so there's no need to keep all these forked tests
    around.
    
    I'll follow up to delete more of the forked behavior if possible.
    Ideally we wouldn't need this flag even if we're still using
    `allowConcurrentByDefault`.

    ## Summary
    
    <!--
    Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem
    does the pull request solve?
    -->
    We are upgrading React 17 codebase to React18, and `StrictMode` has been
    great for surfacing potential production bugs on React18 for class
    components. There are non-trivial number of test failures caused by
    double `useEffect` in StrictMode. To prioritize surfacing and fixing
    issues that will break in production now, we need a flag to turn off
    double `useEffect` for now in StrictMode temporarily. This is a
    Meta-only hack for rolling out `createRoot` and we will fast follow to
    remove it and use full strict mode.
    
    ## How did you test this change?
    
    <!--
    Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and

    Add optional initialValue argument to useDeferredValue (#27500)
    
    Adds a second argument to useDeferredValue called initialValue:
    
    ```js
    const value = useDeferredValue(finalValue, initialValue);
    ```
    
    During the initial render of a component, useDeferredValue will return
    initialValue. Once that render finishes, it will spawn an additional
    render to switch to finalValue.
    
    This same sequence should occur whenever the hook is hidden and revealed
    again, i.e. by a Suspense or Activity, though this part is not yet
    implemented.
    
    When initialValue is not provided, useDeferredValue has no effect during
    initial render, but during an update, it will remain on the previous
    value, then spawn an additional render to switch to the new value. (This
    is the same behavior that exists today.)
    
    During SSR, initialValue is always used, if provided.
    
    This feature is currently behind an experimental flag. We plan to ship
    it in a non-breaking release.

    Switch <Context> to mean <Context.Provider> (#28226)
    
    Previously, `<Context>` was equivalent to `<Context.Consumer>`. However,
    since the introduction of Hooks, the `<Context.Consumer>` API is rarely
    used. The goal here is to make the common case cleaner:
    
    ```js
    const ThemeContext = createContext('light')
    
    function App() {
      return (
        <ThemeContext value="dark">
          ...
        </ThemeContext>
      )
    }
    
    function Button() {
      const theme = use(ThemeContext)
      // ...
    }
    ```
    
    This is technically a breaking change, but we've been warning about
    rendering `<Context>` directly for several years by now, so it's
    unlikely much code in the wild depends on the old behavior. [Proof that
    it warns today (check
    console).](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/peaceful-nobel-pdxtfl)
    
    ---
    
    **The relevant commit is 5696782b428a5ace96e66c1857e13249b6c07958.** It
    switches `createContext` implementation so that `Context.Provider ===
    Context`.
    
    The main assumption that changed is that a Provider's fiber type is now
    the context itself (rather than an intermediate object). Whereas a
    Consumer's fiber type is now always an intermediate object (rather than
    it being sometimes the context itself and sometimes an intermediate
    object).
    
    My methodology was to start with the relevant symbols, work tags, and
    types, and work my way backwards to all usages.
    
    This might break tooling that depends on inspecting React's internal
    fields. I've added DevTools support in the second commit. This didn't
    need explicit versioning—the structure tells us enough.

    cleanup enableProfilerNestedUpdateScheduledHook feature flag (#28509)
    
    ## Summary
    
    Looks like this was added years ago for instrumentation at meta that
    never ended up rolling out. Should be safe to clean up.
    
    ## How did you test this change?
    `yarn test`

    Remove invokeGuardedCallback and replay trick (#28515)
    
    We broke the ability to "break on uncaught exceptions" by adding a
    try/catch higher up in the scheduling. We're giving up on fixing that so
    we can remove the replay trick inside an event handler.
    
    The issue with that approach is that we end up double logging a lot of
    errors in DEV since they get reported to the page.
    
    It's also a lot of complexity around this feature.

    Add `alwaysThrottleDisappearingFallbacks` Flag (#28550)
    
    ## Summary
    
    Creates a new `alwaysThrottleDisappearingFallbacks` feature flag that
    gates the changes from https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/26802
    (instead of being controlled by `alwaysThrottleRetries`). The values of
    this new flag mirror the current values of `alwaysThrottleRetries` such
    that there is no behavior difference.
    
    This additional feature flag allows us to incrementally validate the
    change (arguably bug fix) from
    https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/26802 independently from
    `alwaysThrottleRetries`.

    Cleanup enableUseRefAccessWarning flag
    
    I don't think this flag has a path forward in the current
    implementation. The detection by stack trace is too brittle to detect
    the lazy initialization pattern reliably (see e.g. some internal tests
    that expect the warning because they use lazy intialization, but a
    slightly different pattern then the expected pattern.
    
    I think a new version of this could be to fully ban ref access during
    render with an alternative API for the exceptional cases that today
    require ref access during render.

    Remove defaultProps support (except for classes)  (#28733)
    
    This removes defaultProps support for all component types except for
    classes. We've chosen to continue supporting defaultProps for classes
    because lots of older code relies on it, and unlike function components,
    (which can use default params), there's no straightforward alternative.
    
    By implication, it also removes support for setting defaultProps on
    `React.lazy` wrapper. So this will not work:
    
    ```js
    const MyClassComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./MyClassComponent'));
    // MyClassComponent is not actually a class; it's a lazy wrapper. So
    // defaultProps does not work.
    MyClassComponent.defaultProps = { foo: 'bar' };
    ```
    
    However, if you set the default props on the class itself, then it's
    fine.
    
    For classes, this change also moves where defaultProps are resolved.
    Previously, defaultProps were resolved by the JSX runtime. This change
    is only observable if you introspect a JSX element, which is relatively
    rare but does happen.
    
    In other words, previously `<ClassWithDefaultProp />.props.aDefaultProp`
    would resolve to the default prop value, but now it does not.

    [Experiment] Reuse memo cache after interruption (#28878)
    
    Adds an experimental feature flag to the implementation of useMemoCache,
    the internal cache used by the React Compiler (Forget).
    
    When enabled, instead of treating the cache as copy-on-write, like we do
    with fibers, we share the same cache instance across all render
    attempts, even if the component is interrupted before it commits.
    
    If an update is interrupted, either because it suspended or because of
    another update, we can reuse the memoized computations from the previous
    attempt. We can do this because the React Compiler performs atomic
    writes to the memo cache, i.e. it will not record the inputs to a
    memoization without also recording its output.
    
    This gives us a form of "resuming" within components and hooks.
    
    This only works when updating a component that already mounted. It has
    no impact during initial render, because the memo cache is stored on the
    fiber, and since we have not implemented resuming for fibers, it's
    always a fresh memo cache, anyway.
    
    However, this alone is pretty useful — it happens whenever you update
    the UI with fresh data after a mutation/action, which is extremely
    common in a Suspense-driven (e.g. RSC or Relay) app.
    
    So the impact of this feature is faster data mutations/actions (when the
    React Compiler is used).

    Introduce a faster version of the addProperties function (#28969)
    
    ## Summary
    
    This PR introduces a faster version of the `addProperties` function.
    This new function is basically the `diffProperties` with `prevProps` set
    to `null`, propagated constants, and all the unreachable code paths
    collapsed.
    
    ## How did you test this change?
    
    I've tested this change with [the benchmark
    app](https://github.com/react-native-community/RNNewArchitectureApp/tree/new-architecture-benchmarks)
    and got ~4.4% improvement in the view creation time.

    Add flag to test fast jsx (#28816)
    
    Following #28768, add a path to testing Fast JSX on www.
    
    We want to measure the impact of Fast JSX and enable a path to testing
    before string refs are completely removed in www (which is a work in
    progress).
    
    Without `disableStringRefs`, we need to copy any object with a `ref` key
    so we can pass it through `coerceStringRef()` and copy it into the
    object. This de-opt path is what is gated behind
    `enableFastJSXWithStringRefs`.
    
    The additional checks should have no perf impact in OSS as the flags
    remain true there and the build output is not changed. For www, I've
    benchmarked the addition of the boolean checks with values cached at
    module scope. There is no significant change observed from our
    benchmarks and any latency will apply to test and control branches
    evenly. This added experiment complexity is temporary. We should be able
    to clean it up, along with the flag checks for `enableRefAsProp` and
    `disableStringRefs` shortly.

    [Fiber] render boundary in fallback if it contains a new stylesheet during sync update (#28965)
    
    Updates Suspensey instances and resources to preload even during urgent
    updates and to potentially suspend.
    
    The current implementation is unchanged for transitions but for sync
    updates if there is a suspense boundary above the resource/instance it
    will be rendered in fallback mode instead.
    
    Note: This behavior is not what we want for images once we make them
    suspense enabled. We will need to have forked behavior here to
    distinguish between stylesheets which should never commit when not
    loaded and images which should commit after a small delay

    Experiment with using an object literal for Fiber creation (#28734)
    
    Object literals should be faster at least on React Native with Hermes as
    the JS engine.
    It might also be interesting to confirm the old comments in this file
    from years ago are even still valid. Creating an object from a literal
    should be a simpler operation.
    
    It's a bit unfortunate that this introduces a bunch of copied code, but
    since we rearely update the fields on fibers, this seems like an okay
    tradeoff for a hot code path. An alternative would be some sort of macro
    system, but that doesn't seem worth the extra complexity.

    Feature flag to disable legacy context for function components (#30319)
    
    While the goal is to remove legacy context completely, I think we can
    already land the removal of legacy context for function components. I
    didn't even know this feature existed until reading the code recently.
    
    The win is just a couple of property lookups on function renders, but it
    trims down the API already as the full removal will likely still take a
    bit more time.
    
    www: Starting with enabled test renderer and a feature flag for
    production rollout.
    
    RN: Not enabled, will follow up on this.

    Call cleanup of insertion effects when hidden (#30954)
    
    Insertion effects do not unmount when a subtree is removed while
    offscreen.
    
    Current behavior for an insertion effect is if the component goes
    
    - *visible -> removed:* calls insertion effect cleanup
    - *visible -> offscreen -> removed:* insertion effect cleanup is never
    called
    
    This makes it so we always call insertion effect cleanup when removing
    the component.
    
    Likely also fixes https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/26670

    Use fastAddProperties in diffing (#32243)
    
    ## Summary
    
    `fastAddProperties` has shown some perf benefits when used for creating
    props payload for new components. In this PR we'll try to use it for
    diffing props for existing components.
    
    It would be good enough if it simply doesn't regress perf. We'll be able
    to delete the old `addProperties`, and make `fastAddProperties` the
    default behaviour.
    
    ## How did you test this change?
    
    ```
    yarn lint
    yarn flow native
    yarn test packages/react-native-renderer -r=xplat --variant=false
    yarn test packages/react-native-renderer -r=xplat --variant=true

    [RN] Set up test to create public instances lazily in Fabric (#32363)
    
    ## Summary
    
    In React Native, public instances and internal host nodes are not
    represented by the same object (ReactNativeElement & shadow nodes vs.
    just DOM elements), and the only one that's required for rendering is
    the shadow node. Public instances are generally only necessary when
    accessed via refs or events, and that usually happens for a small amount
    of components in the tree.
    
    This implements an optimization to create the public instance on demand,
    instead of eagerly creating it when creating the host node. We expect
    this to improve performance by reducing the logic we do per node and the
    number of object allocations.
    
    ## How did you test this change?
    
    Manually synced the changes to React Native and run Fantom tests and
    benchmarks, with the flag enabled and disabled. All tests pass in both
    cases, and benchmarks show a slight but consistent performance
    improvement.

    Add ref to Fragment (#32465)
    
    *This API is experimental and subject to change or removal.*
    
    This PR is an alternative to
    https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/32421 based on feedback:
    https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/32421#pullrequestreview-2625382015
    . The difference here is that we traverse from the Fragment's fiber at
    operation time instead of keeping a set of children on the
    `FragmentInstance`. We still need to handle newly added or removed child
    nodes to apply event listeners and observers, so we treat those updates
    as effects.
    
    **Fragment Refs**
    
    This PR extends React's Fragment component to accept a `ref` prop. The
    Fragment's ref will attach to a custom host instance, which will provide
    an Element-like API for working with the Fragment's host parent and host
    children.
    
    Here I've implemented `addEventListener`, `removeEventListener`, and
    `focus` to get started but we'll be iterating on this by adding
    additional APIs in future PRs. This sets up the mechanism to attach refs
    and perform operations on children. The FragmentInstance is implemented
    in `react-dom` here but is planned for Fabric as well.
    
    The API works by targeting the first level of host children and proxying
    Element-like APIs to allow developers to manage groups of elements or
    elements that cannot be easily accessed such as from a third-party
    library or deep in a tree of Functional Component wrappers.
    
    ```javascript
    import {Fragment, useRef} from 'react';
    
    const fragmentRef = useRef(null);
    
    <Fragment ref={fragmentRef}>
      <div id="A" />
      <Wrapper>
        <div id="B">
          <div id="C" />
        </div>
      </Wrapper>
      <div id="D" />
    </Fragment>
    ```
    
    In this case, calling `fragmentRef.current.addEventListener()` would
    apply an event listener to `A`, `B`, and `D`. `C` is skipped because it
    is nested under the first level of Host Component. If another Host
    Component was appended as a sibling to `A`, `B`, or `D`, the event
    listener would be applied to that element as well and any other APIs
    would also affect the newly added child.
    
    This is an implementation of the basic feature as a starting point for
    feedback and further iteration.

    Set accurate value for alwaysThrottleRetries on www (#32684)
    
    This flag value was updated in
    https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/28965 (seemingly unrelated, maybe
    as part of unit testing). But its still controlled by a dynamic flag in
    www. Let's update this to VARIANT to accurately represent the state of
    the rollout.

    Fix ownerStackLimit feature gating for tests (#32726)
    
    https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/32529 added a dynamic flag for
    this, but that breaks tests since the flags are not defined everywhere.
    
    However, this is a static value and the flag is only for supporting
    existing tests. So we can override it in the test config, and make it
    static at built time instead.

    [crud] Revert CRUD overload (#32741)
    
    Cleans up this experiment. After some internal experimentation we are
    deprioritizing this project for now and may revisit it at a later point.
