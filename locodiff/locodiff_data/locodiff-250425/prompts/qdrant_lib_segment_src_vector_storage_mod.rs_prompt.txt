# Instructions

You are being benchmarked. You will see the output of a git log command, and from that must infer the current state of a file. Think carefully, as you must output the exact state of the file to earn full marks.

**Important:** Your goal is to reproduce the file's content *exactly* as it exists at the final commit, even if the code appears broken, buggy, or contains obvious errors. Do **not** try to "fix" the code. Attempting to correct issues will result in a poor score, as this benchmark evaluates your ability to reproduce the precise state of the file based on its history.

# Required Response Format

Wrap the content of the file in triple backticks (```). Any text outside the final closing backticks will be ignored. End your response after outputting the closing backticks.

# Example Response

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
print('Hello, world!')
```

# File History

    Add support for deleted vectors in segments (#1724)
    
    * Use resize rather than while-push loop
    
    * Add deleted flags to simple vector storage
    
    * Add deleted flag to memmap vector storage
    
    * Map BitSlice on mmap file for deleted flags
    
    * Use vector specific deletion BitSlice in RawScorer
    
    * Use BitSlice for deleted points, fix check point logic, clarify names
    
    * Extract div_ceil function to shared module
    
    * We can use unchecked set and replace because we just checked the length
    
    * Add deleted count function to vector storage
    
    * Add vector storage point deletion tests
    
    * Keep deleted state in simple vector storage with update_from, add test
    
    * Keep deleted state in memmap vector storage with update_from, add test
    
    * Simplify div_ceil
    
    * Improve deletion handling in update_from in mmap vector storage
    
    * Improve performance, use trickery to get BitSlice view over deleted mmap
    
    * Use BitSlice where possible, construct BitVec more efficiently
    
    * Incorporate vector specific delete flags in quantized raw scorer
    
    * Don't pin MmapMut, it is not required
    
    * With quantization, keep mmap deleted flags in RAM for better performance
    
    * Advice the kernel to prepare deleted flags mmap for faster future access
    
    * Simplify deleted bitslice access, add bound check, remove unused function
    
    * Fix compilation on Windows
    
    * Cleanup
    
    * Rename delete functions to delete_{point,vec} to prevent confusion
    
    * Use then_some rather than match a boolean
    
    * Lock deleted flags in memory only when quantization is available
    
    * Add docs and stabilize issue link to dev_ceil
    
    * Flush deleted mmap when closing segment
    
    This requires us to to wrap the memory map struct in an Arc and Mutex.
    Though this may look inefficient, it doesn't have a negative side effect
    on deleted flag performance, because the flags are accessed through a
    BitSlice that is separate and doesn't use locking.
    
    * Rename some point functions to vec because that makes more sense
    
    * Simplify delete flag fetching option, use deref func instead of asterisk
    
    * Do not calculate slice size manually, use size_of_val
    
    * remove test raw scorer
    
    * use deref in check

    * Random bool has 0.5 as standard distribution, use iter::repeat_with
    
    * Replace RemovableMmap::new with Default derive
    
    * Rename len to num_flags
    
    * Use Option replace as it is convention alongside take
    
    * Add FileId enum to replace error prone manual ID rotating
    
    * Use debug_assert_eq where applicable
    
    * Refactor drop and set to replace
    
    * Change default chunk size for chunked mmap vectors to 32MB
    
    This change is made as per GitHub review, because allocating a few
    storages with 128MB would take a significant amount of time and storage.

    Compatibility for mmap sparse vectors (#5454)
    
    * implement mmap sparse vector storage
    
    * add to VectorStorageEnum
    
    * clippy
    
    * add tests, fix both simple and mmap storages
    
    * smol correction on total_vector_count
    
    * add sparse storage type to config
    
    * fix reading config without storage type
    
    * generate openapi
    
    * use blob_store by path
    
    * hidden setting to enable new storage
    
    * validate existing path in `BlobStore::open()`
    
    * use new dir for each sparse vector name
    
    * fix and rename `max_point_offset`
    
    Plus some extra refactors
    
    * add storage compat test, to always check both storages work
    
    * fix opening of storage + other misc fixes
    
    * FIX!!!
    
    `Unset` operations in the Tracker weren't updating the
    `next_pointer_id`. So, when reopening the storage, those points wouldn't
    get marked as deleted in the bitslice, thus creating the illusion that
    they should exist, when they did not.
    
    * refactor naming from `iter_*` to `for_each_*`
    
    * fix checking for BlobStore existance
    
    * fix typo
    
    * fix error message
    
    * better docs for open_or_create
    
    * fix after rebase
