# Instructions

You are being benchmarked. You will see the output of a git log command, and from that must infer the current state of a file. Think carefully, as you must output the exact state of the file to earn full marks.

**Important:** Your goal is to reproduce the file's content *exactly* as it exists at the final commit, even if the code appears broken, buggy, or contains obvious errors. Do **not** try to "fix" the code. Attempting to correct issues will result in a poor score, as this benchmark evaluates your ability to reproduce the precise state of the file based on its history.

# Required Response Format

Wrap the content of the file in triple backticks (```). Any text outside the final closing backticks will be ignored. End your response after outputting the closing backticks.

# Example Response

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
print('Hello, world!')
```

commit 376d5c1b5aa17724c5fea9412f8fcde14a7b23f1
Author: Andrew Clark <git@andrewclark.io>

    Split cross-package types from implementation
    
    Some of our internal reconciler types have leaked into other packages.
    Usually, these types are treated as opaque; we don't read and write
    to its fields. This is good.
    
    However, the type is often passed back to a reconciler method. For
    example, React DOM creates a FiberRoot with `createContainer`, then
    passes that root to `updateContainer`. It doesn't do anything with the
    root except pass it through, but because `updateContainer` expects a
    full FiberRoot, React DOM is still coupled to all its fields.
    
    I don't know if there's an idiomatic way to handle this in Flow. Opaque
    types are simlar, but those only work within a single file. AFAIK,
    there's no way to use a package as the boundary for opaqueness.
    
    The immediate problem this presents is that the reconciler refactor will
    involve changes to our internal data structures. I don't want to have to
    fork every single package that happens to pass through a Fiber or
    FiberRoot, or access any one of its fields. So my current plan is to
    share the same Flow type across both forks. The shared type will be a
    superset of each implementation's type, e.g. Fiber will have both an
    `expirationTime` field and a `lanes` field. The implementations will
    diverge, but not the types.
    
    To do this, I lifted the type definitions into a separate module.

    Make ExpirationTime an opaque type (#18732)
    
    * Add LanePriority type
    
    React's internal scheduler has more priority levels than the external
    Scheduler package. Let's use React as the source of truth for tracking
    the priority of updates so we have more control. We'll still fall back
    to Scheduler in the default case. In the future, we should consider
    removing `runWithPriority` from Scheduler and replacing the valid use
    cases with React-specific APIs.
    
    This commit adds a new type, called a LanePriority to disambiguate from
    the Scheduler one.
    
    ("Lane" refers to another type that I'm planning. It roughly translates
    to "thread." Each lane will have a priority associated with it.)
    
    I'm not actually using the lane anywhere, yet. Only setting stuff up.
    
    * Remove expiration times train model
    
    In the old reconciler, expiration times are computed by applying an
    offset to the current system time. This has the effect of increasing
    the priority of updates as time progresses. Because we also use
    expiration times as a kind of "thread" identifier, it turns out this
    is quite limiting because we can only flush work sequentially along
    the timeline.
    
    The new model will use a bitmask to represent parallel threads that
    can be worked on in any combination and in any order.
    
    In this commit, expiration times and the linear timeline are still in
    place, but they are no longer based on a timestamp. Effectively, they
    are constants based on their priority level.
    
    * Stop using ExpirationTime to represent timestamps
    
    Follow up to the previous commit. This converts the remaining places
    where we were using the ExpirationTime type to represent a timestamp,
    like Suspense timeouts.
    
    * Fork Dependencies and PendingInteractionMap types
    
    These contain expiration times
    
    * Make ExpirationTime an opaque type
    
    ExpirationTime is currently just an alias for the `number` type, for a
    few reasons. One is that it predates Flow's opaque type feature. Another
    is that making it opaque means we have to move all our comparisons and
    number math to the ExpirationTime module, and use utility functions
    everywhere else.
    
    However, this is actually what we want in the new system, because the
    Lanes type that will replace ExpirationTime is a bitmask with a
    particular layout, and performing operations on it will involve more
    than just number comparisions and artihmetic. I don't want this logic to
    spread ad hoc around the whole codebase.
    
    The utility functions get inlined by Closure so it doesn't matter
    performance-wise.
    
    I automated most of the changes with JSCodeshift, with only a few manual
    tweaks to stuff like imports. My goal was to port the logic exactly to
    prevent subtle mistakes, without trying to simplify anything in the
    process. I'll likely need to audit many of these sites again when I
    replace them with the new type, though, especially the ones
    in ReactFiberRoot.
    
    I added the codemods I used to the `scripts` directory. I won't merge
    these to master. I'll remove them in a subsequent commit. I'm only
    committing them here so they show up in the PR for future reference.
    
    I had a lot of trouble getting Flow to pass. Somehow it was not
    inferring the correct type of the constants exported from the
    ExpirationTime module, despite being annotated correctly.
    
    I tried converting them them to constructor functions — `NoWork`
    becomes `NoWork()` — and that made it work. I used that to unblock me,
    and fixed all the other type errors. Once there were no more type
    errors, I tried converting the constructors back to constants. Started
    getting errors again.
    
    Then I added a type constraint everywhere a constant was referenced.
    That fixed it. I also figured out that you only have to add a constraint
    when the constant is passed to another function, even if the function is
    annotated. So this indicates to me that it's probably a Flow bug. I'll
    file an issue with Flow.
    
    * Delete temporary codemods used in previous commit
    
    I only added these to the previous commit so that I can easily run it
    again when rebasing. When the stack is squashed, it will be as if they
    never existed.

    Initial Lanes implementation (#18796)
    
    See PR #18796 for more information.
    
    All of the changes I've made in this commit are behind the
    `enableNewReconciler` flag. Merging this to master will not affect the
    open source builds or the build that we ship to Facebook.
    
    The only build that is affected is the `ReactDOMForked` build, which is
    deployed to Facebook **behind an experimental flag (currently disabled
    for all users)**. We will use this flag to gradually roll out the new
    reconciler, and quickly roll it back if we find any problems.
    
    Because we have those protections in place, what I'm aiming for with
    this initial PR is the **smallest possible atomic change that lands
    cleanly and doesn't rely on too many hacks**. The goal has not been to
    get every single test or feature passing, and it definitely is not to
    implement all the features that we intend to build on top of the new
    model. When possible, I have chosen to preserve existing semantics and
    defer changes to follow-up steps. (Listed in the section below.)
    
    (I did not end up having to disable any tests, although if I had, that
    should not have necessarily been a merge blocker.)
    
    For example, even though one of the primary goals of this project is to
    improve our model for parallel Suspense transitions, in this initial
    implementation, I have chosen to keep the same core heuristics for
    sequencing and flushing that existed in the ExpirationTimes model: low
    priority updates cannot finish without also finishing high priority
    ones.
    
    Despite all these precautions, **because the scope of this refactor is
    inherently large, I do expect we will find regressions.** The flip side
    is that I also expect the new model to improve the stability of the
    codebase and make it easier to fix bugs when they arise.

    add new IDs for each each server renderer instance and prefixes to distinguish between each server render (#18576)
    
    There is a worry that `useOpaqueIdentifier` might run out of unique IDs if running for long enough. This PR moves the unique ID counter so it's generated per server renderer object instead. For people who render different subtrees, this PR adds a prefix option to `renderToString`, `renderToStaticMarkup`, `renderToNodeStream`, and `renderToStaticNodeStream` so identifiers can be differentiated for each individual subtree.

    Detect and prevent render starvation, per lane (#18864)
    
    * Detect and prevent render starvation, per lane
    
    If an update is CPU-bound for longer than expected according to its
    priority, we assume it's being starved by other work on the main thread.
    
    To detect this, we keep track of the elapsed time using a fixed-size
    array where each slot corresponds to a lane. What we actually store is
    the event time when the lane first became CPU-bound.
    
    Then, when receiving a new update or yielding to the main thread, we
    check how long each lane has been pending. If the time exceeds a
    threshold constant corresponding to its priority, we mark it as expired
    to force it to synchronously finish.
    
    We don't want to mistake time elapsed while an update is IO-bound
    (waiting for data to resolve) for time when it is CPU-bound. So when a
    lane suspends, we clear its associated event time from the array. When
    it receives a signal to try again, either a ping or an update, we assign
    a new event time to restart the clock.
    
    * Store as expiration time, not start time
    
    I originally stored the start time because I thought I could use this
    in the future to also measure Suspense timeouts. (Event times are
    currently stored on each update object for this purpose.) But that
    won't work because in the case of expiration times, we reset the clock
    whenever the update becomes IO-bound. So to replace the per-update
    field, I'm going to have to track those on the room separately from
    expiration times.

    useMutableSource: "Entangle" instead of expiring (#18889)
    
    * useMutableSource: "Entangle" instead of expiring
    
    A lane is said to be entangled with another when it's not allowed to
    render in a batch that does not also include the other lane.
    
    This commit implements entanglement for `useMutableSource`. If a source
    is mutated in between when it's read in the render phase, but before
    it's subscribed to in the commit phase, we must account for whether the
    same source has pending mutations elsewhere. The old subscriptions must
    not be allowed to re-render without also including the new subscription
    (and vice versa), to prevent tearing.
    
    In the old reconciler, we did this by synchronously flushing all the
    pending subscription updates. This works, but isn't ideal. The new
    reconciler can entangle the updates without de-opting to sync.
    
    In the future, we plan to use this same mechanism for other features,
    like skipping over intermediate useTransition states.
    
    * Use clz instead of ctrz to pick an arbitrary lane
    
    Should be slightly faster since most engines have built-in support.

    Land Lanes implementation in old fork (#19108)
    
    * Add autofix to cross-fork lint rule
    
    * replace-fork: Replaces old fork contents with new
    
    For each file in the new fork, copies the contents into the
    corresponding file of the old fork, replacing what was already there.
    
    In contrast to merge-fork, which performs a three-way merge.
    
    * Replace old fork contents with new fork
    
    First I ran  `yarn replace-fork`.
    
    Then I ran `yarn lint` with autofix enabled. There's currently no way to
    do that from the command line (we should fix that), so I had to edit the
    lint script file.
    
    * Manual fix-ups
    
    Removes dead branches, removes prefixes from internal fields.  Stuff
    like that.
    
    * Fix DevTools tests
    
    DevTools tests only run against the old fork, which is why I didn't
    catch these earlier.
    
    There is one test that is still failing. I'm fairly certain it's related
    to the layout of the Suspense fiber: we no longer conditionally wrap the
    primary children. They are always wrapped in an extra fiber.
    
    Since this has been running in www for weeks without major issues, I'll
    defer fixing the remaining test to a follow up.

    Effects list refactor continued: did-bailout flag (#19322)
    
    * Effects list rewrite
    
    * Improved deletions approach
    
    Process deletions as we traverse the tree during commit, before we process other effects. This has the result of better mimicking the previous sequencing.
    
    * Made deletions field nullable
    
    * Revert (no longer necessary) change to ReactNative test
    
    * Eagerly set Deletions effect on Fiber when adding child to deletions array
    
    * Initialize deletions array to null
    
    * Null out deletions array instead of splicing 🤡
    
    * Removed TODO comment
    
    * Initial exploration on a did-bailout flag
    
    * fixed the rest of the bugs
    
    * Rolled temporary didBailout attribute into subtreeTag
    
    * addressed comments
    
    * Removed DidBailout subtree tag
    
    * Removed stale comment
    
    * use while loop instead of recursion for siblings
    
    * move bailout flag from while loop
    
    * Removed some unnecessary Deletion effectTags from children
    
    * Move Deletion effect assignment to deletions array initialization

    Track event times per lane on the root (#19387)
    
    * Pass event time to markRootUpdated
    
    Some minor rearranging so that eventTime gets threaded through. No
    change in behavior.
    
    * Track event times per lane on the root
    
    Previous strategy was to store the event time on the update object
    and accumulate the most recent one during the render phase.
    
    Among other advantages, by tracking them on the root, we can read the
    event time before the render phase has finished.
    
    I haven't removed the `eventTime` field from the update object yet,
    because it's still used to compute the timeout. Tracking the timeout
    on the root is my next step.

    Replace SuspenseConfig object with an integer (#19706)
    
    Now that the options in SuspenseConfig are no longer supported, the
    only thing we use it for is to track whether an update is part of
    a transition.
    
    I've renamed `ReactCurrentBatchConfig.suspense` to
    `ReactCurrentBatchConfig.transition`, and changed the type to a number.
    The number is always either 0 or 1. I could have made it a boolean;
    however, most likely this will eventually be either a Lane or an
    incrementing identifier.
    
    The `withSuspenseConfig` export still exists until we've removed
    all the callers from www.

    And `useDeferredValue`.
    
    The options were already disabled in previous commits, so this doesn't
    change any behavior. I upated type signatures and cleaned up the hook
    implementation a bit — no longer have to wrap the `start` method with
    `useCallback`, because its only remaining dependency is a `setState`
    method, which never changes. Instead, we can store the `start` method
    on a ref.

    Combine Flags and SubtreeFlags types (#19775)
    
    Because the `subtreeFlags` is the union of all the flags present in
    a subtree, we can use the same type as `flags`.
    
    One practical benefit is that we can bubble up the flags from the
    children with a single `|=` operator.
    
    Structurally, everything else about the effect algorithm is unchanged.

    [Flight] Add getCacheForType() to the dispatcher (#20315)
    
    * Remove react/unstable_cache
    
    We're probably going to make it available via the dispatcher. Let's remove this for now.
    
    * Add readContext() to the dispatcher
    
    On the server, it will be per-request.
    
    On the client, there will be some way to shadow it.
    
    For now, I provide it on the server, and throw on the client.
    
    * Use readContext() from react-fetch
    
    This makes it work on the server (but not on the client until we implement it there.)
    
    Updated the test to use Server Components. Now it passes.
    
    * Fixture: Add fetch from a Server Component
    
    * readCache -> getCacheForType<T>
    
    * Add React.unstable_getCacheForType
    
    * Add a feature flag
    
    * Fix Flow
    
    * Add react-suspense-test-utils and port tests
    
    * Remove extra Map lookup
    
    * Unroll async/await because build system
    
    * Add some error coverage and retry

    Fork ReactFiberLane (#20371)
    
    This wasn't forked previously because Lane and associated types are
    opaque, and they leak into non-reconciler packages. So forking the type
    would also require forking all those other packages.
    
    But I really want to use the reconciler fork infra for lanes changes.
    So I made them no longer opaque.
    
    Another possible solution would be to add separate `new` and `old`
    fields to the Fiber type, like I did when migrating from expiration
    times. But that seems so excessive. This seems fine.
    
    But we should still treat them like they're opaque and only do lanes
    manipulation in the ReactFiberLane module. At least until the model
    stabilizes more. We'll just need to enforce this with discipline
    instead of with the type system.

    Move context comparison to consumer
    
    In the lazy context implementation, not all context changes are
    propagated from the provider, so we can't rely on the propagation alone
    to mark the consumer as dirty. The consumer needs to compare to the
    previous value, like we do for state and context.
    
    I added a `memoizedValue` field to the context dependency type. Then in
    the consumer, we iterate over the current dependencies to see if
    something changed. We only do this iteration after props and state has
    already bailed out, so it's a relatively uncommon path, except at the
    root of a changed subtree. Alternatively, we could move these
    comparisons into `readContext`, but that's a much hotter path, so I
    think this is an appropriate trade off.

    Remove unstable_changedBits (#20953)
    
    We added this unstable feature a few years ago, as a way to opt out of
    context updates, but it didn't prove useful in practice.
    
    We have other proposals for how to address the same problem, like
    context selectors.
    
    Since it was prefixed with `unstable_`, we should be able to remove it
    without consequence. The hook API already warned if you used it.
    
    Even if someone is using it somewhere, it's meant to be an optimization
    only, so if they are using the API properly, it should not have any
    semantic impact.

    Entangled expired lanes with SyncLane (#21083)
    
    Makes the implementation simpler. Expiration is now a special case of
    entanglement.
    
    Also fixes an issue where expired lanes weren't batched with normal
    sync updates. (See deleted TODO comment in test.)

    I originally kept the React PriorityLevel and Scheduler PriorityLevel
    types separate in case there was a versioning mismatch between the two
    modules. However, it looks like we're going to keep the Scheduler module
    private in the short to medium term, and longer term the public

    (the switch statements that convert between the two types).

    Track which fibers scheduled the current render work (#15658)
    
    Tracked Fibers are called "updaters" and are exposed to DevTools via a 'memoizedUpdaters' property on the ReactFiberRoot. The implementation of this feature follows a vaguely similar approach as interaction tracing, but does not require reference counting since there is no subscriptions API.
    
    This change is in support of a new DevTools Profiler feature that shows which Fiber(s) scheduled the selected commit in the Profiler.
    
    All changes have been gated behind a new feature flag, 'enableUpdaterTracking', which is enabled for Profiling builds by default. We also only track updaters when DevTools has been detected, to avoid doing unnecessary work.

    Expiration: Do nothing except disable time slicing (#21345)
    
    We have a feature called "expiration" whose purpose is to prevent
    a concurrent update from being starved by higher priority events.
    If a lane is CPU-bound for too long, we finish the rest of the work
    synchronously without allowing further interruptions.
    
    In the current implementation, we do this in sort of a roundabout way:
    once a lane is determined to have expired, we entangle it with SyncLane
    and switch to the synchronous work loop.
    
    There are a few flaws with the approach. One is that SyncLane has a
    particular semantic meaning besides its non-yieldiness. For example,
    `flushSync` will force remaining Sync work to finish; currently, that
    also includes expired work, which isn't an intended behavior, but rather
    an artifact of the implementation.
    
    An event worse example is that passive effects triggered by a Sync
    update are flushed synchronously, before paint, so that its result
    is guaranteed to be observed by the next discrete event. But expired
    work has no such requirement: we're flushing expired effects before
    paint unnecessarily.
    
    Aside from the behaviorial implications, the current implementation has
    proven to be fragile: more than once, we've accidentally regressed
    performance due to a subtle change in how expiration is handled.
    
    This PR aims to radically simplify how we model starvation protection by
    scaling back the implementation as much as possible. In this new model,
    if a lane is expired, we disable time slicing. That's it. We don't
    entangle it with SyncLane. The only thing we do is skip the call to
    `shouldYield` in between each time slice. This is identical to how we
    model synchronous-by-default updates in React 18.

    Implement useSyncExternalStore on server (#22347)
    
    Adds a third argument called `getServerSnapshot`.
    
    On the server, React calls this one instead of the normal `getSnapshot`.
    We also call it during hydration.
    
    So it represents the snapshot that is used to generate the initial,
    server-rendered HTML. The purpose is to avoid server-client mismatches.
    What we render during hydration needs to match up exactly with what we
    render on the server.
    
    The pattern is for the server to send down a serialized copy of the
    store that was used to generate the initial HTML. On the client, React
    will call either `getSnapshot` or `getServerSnapshot` on the client as
    appropriate, depending on whether it's currently hydrating.
    
    The argument is optional for fully client rendered use cases. If the
    user does attempt to omit `getServerSnapshot`, and the hook is called
    on the server, React will abort that subtree on the server and
    revert to client rendering, up to the nearest Suspense boundary.
    
    For the userspace shim, we will need to use a heuristic (canUseDOM)
    to determine whether we are in a server environment. I'll do that in
    a follow up.

    Add back useMutableSource temporarily (#22396)
    
    Recoil uses useMutableSource behind a flag. I thought this was fine
    because Recoil isn't used in any concurrent roots, so the behavior
    would be the same, but it turns out that it is used by concurrent
    roots in a few places.
    
    I'm not expecting it to be hard to migrate to useSyncExternalStore, but
    to de-risk the change I'm going to roll it out gradually with a flag. In
    the meantime, I've added back the useMutableSource API.

    root.hydrate -> root.isDehydrated (#22420)
    
    I think this naming is a bit clearer. It means the root is currently
    showing server rendered content that needs to be hydrated.
    
    A dehydrated root is conceptually the same as what we call dehydrated
    Suspense boundary, so this makes the naming of the root align with the
    naming of subtrees.

    Initial implementation of cache cleanup (#22510)
    
    This is an initial, partial implementation of a cleanup mechanism for the experimental Cache API. The idea is that consumers of the Cache API can register to be informed when a given Cache instance is no longer needed so that they can perform associated cleanup tasks to free resources stored in the cache. A canonical example would be cancelling pending network requests.
    
    An overview of the high-level changes:
    
    * Changes the `Cache` type from a Map of cache instances to be an object with the original Map of instances, a reference count (to count roughly "active references" to the cache instances - more below), and an AbortController.
    * Adds a new public API, `unstable_getCacheSignal(): AbortSignal`, which is callable during render. It returns an AbortSignal tied to the lifetime of the cache - developers can listen for the 'abort' event on the signal, which React now triggers when a given cache instance is no longer referenced.
      * Note that `AbortSignal` is a web standard that is supported by other platform APIs; for example a signal can be passed to `fetch()` to trigger cancellation of an HTTP request.
    * Implements the above - triggering the 'abort' event - by handling passive mount/unmount for HostRoot and CacheComponent fiber nodes.
    
    Cases handled:
    * Aborted transitions: we clean up a new cache created for an aborted transition
    * Suspense: we retain a fresh cache instance until a suspended tree resolves
    
    For follow-ups:
    * When a subsequent cache refresh is issued before a previous refresh completes, the refreshes are queued. Fresh cache instances for previous refreshes in the queue should be cleared, retaining only the most recent cache. I plan to address this in a follow-up PR.
    * If a refresh is cancelled, the fresh cache should be cleaned up.

    useId (#22644)
    
    * Add useId to dispatcher
    
    * Initial useId implementation
    
    Ids are base 32 strings whose binary representation corresponds to the
    position of a node in a tree.
    
    Every time the tree forks into multiple children, we add additional bits
    to the left of the sequence that represent the position of the child
    within the current level of children.
    
        00101       00010001011010101
        ╰─┬─╯       ╰───────┬───────╯
      Fork 5 of 20       Parent id
    
    The leading 0s are important. In the above example, you only need 3 bits
    to represent slot 5. However, you need 5 bits to represent all the forks
    at the current level, so we must account for the empty bits at the end.
    
    For this same reason, slots are 1-indexed instead of 0-indexed.
    Otherwise, the zeroth id at a level would be indistinguishable from
    its parent.
    
    If a node has only one child, and does not materialize an id (i.e. does
    not contain a useId hook), then we don't need to allocate any space in
    the sequence. It's treated as a transparent indirection. For example,
    these two trees produce the same ids:
    
    <>                          <>
      <Indirection>               <A />
        <A />                     <B />
      </Indirection>            </>
      <B />
    </>
    
    However, we cannot skip any materializes an id. Otherwise, a parent id
    that does not fork would be indistinguishable from its child id. For
    example, this tree does not fork, but the parent and child must have
    different ids.
    
    <Parent>
      <Child />
    </Parent>
    
    To handle this scenario, every time we materialize an id, we allocate a
    new level with a single slot. You can think of this as a fork with only
    one prong, or an array of children with length 1.
    
    It's possible for the the size of the sequence to exceed 32 bits, the
    max size for bitwise operations. When this happens, we make more room by
    converting the right part of the id to a string and storing it in an
    overflow variable. We use a base 32 string representation, because 32 is
    the largest power of 2 that is supported by toString(). We want the base
    to be large so that the resulting ids are compact, and we want the base
    to be a power of 2 because every log2(base) bits corresponds to a single
    character, i.e. every log2(32) = 5 bits. That means we can lop bits off
    the end 5 at a time without affecting the final result.
    
    * Incremental hydration
    
    Stores the tree context on the dehydrated Suspense boundary's state
    object so it resume where it left off.
    
    * Add useId to react-debug-tools
    
    * Add selective hydration test
    
    Demonstrates that selective hydration works and ids are preserved even
    after subsequent client updates.

    Implement identifierPrefix option for useId (#22855)
    
    When an `identifierPrefix` option is given, React will add it to the
    beginning of ids generated by `useId`.
    
    The main use case is to avoid conflicts when there are multiple React
    roots on a single page.
    
    The server API already supported an `identifierPrefix` option. It's not
    only used by `useId`, but also for React-generated ids that are used to
    stitch together chunks of HTML, among other things. I added a
    corresponding option to the client.
    
    You must pass the same prefix option to both the server and client.
    Eventually we may make this automatic by sending the prefix from the
    server as part of the HTML stream.

    Add onRecoverableError option to hydrateRoot, createRoot (#23207)
    
    * [RFC] Add onHydrationError option to hydrateRoot
    
    This is not the final API but I'm pushing it for discussion purposes.
    
    When an error is thrown during hydration, we fallback to client
    rendering, without triggering an error boundary. This is good because,
    in many cases, the UI will recover and the user won't even notice that
    something has gone wrong behind the scenes.
    
    However, we shouldn't recover from these errors silently, because the
    underlying cause might be pretty serious. Server-client mismatches are
    not supposed to happen, even if UI doesn't break from the users
    perspective. Ignoring them could lead to worse problems later. De-opting
    from server to client rendering could also be a significant performance
    regression, depending on the scope of the UI it affects.
    
    So we need a way to log when hydration errors occur.
    
    This adds a new option for `hydrateRoot` called `onHydrationError`. It's
    symmetrical to the server renderer's `onError` option, and serves the
    same purpose.
    
    When no option is provided, the default behavior is to schedule a
    browser task and rethrow the error. This will trigger the normal browser
    behavior for errors, including dispatching an error event. If the app
    already has error monitoring, this likely will just work as expected
    without additional configuration.
    
    However, we can also expose additional metadata about these errors, like
    which Suspense boundaries were affected by the de-opt to client
    rendering. (I have not exposed any metadata in this commit; API needs
    more design work.)
    
    There are other situations besides hydration where we recover from an
    error without surfacing it to the user, or notifying an error boundary.
    For example, if an error occurs during a concurrent render, it could be
    due to a data race, so we try again synchronously in case that fixes it.
    We should probably expose a way to log these types of errors, too. (Also
    not implemented in this commit.)
    
    * Log all recoverable errors
    
    This expands the scope of onHydrationError to include all errors that
    are not surfaced to the UI (an error boundary). In addition to errors
    that occur during hydration, this also includes errors that recoverable
    by de-opting to synchronous rendering. Typically (or really, by
    definition) these errors are the result of a concurrent data race;
    blocking the main thread fixes them by prevents subsequent races.
    
    The logic for de-opting to synchronous rendering already existed. The
    only thing that has changed is that we now log the errors instead of
    silently proceeding.
    
    The logging API has been renamed from onHydrationError
    to onRecoverableError.
    
    * Don't log recoverable errors until commit phase
    
    If the render is interrupted and restarts, we don't want to log the
    errors multiple times.
    
    This change only affects errors that are recovered by de-opting to
    synchronous rendering; we'll have to do something else for errors
    during hydration, since they use a different recovery path.
    
    * Only log hydration error if client render succeeds
    
    Similar to previous step.
    
    When an error occurs during hydration, we only want to log it if falling
    back to client rendering _succeeds_. If client rendering fails,
    the error will get reported to the nearest error boundary, so there's
    no need for a duplicate log.
    
    To implement this, I added a list of errors to the hydration context.
    If the Suspense boundary successfully completes, they are added to
    the main recoverable errors queue (the one I added in the
    previous step.)
    
    * Log error with queueMicrotask instead of Scheduler
    
    If onRecoverableError is not provided, we default to rethrowing the
    error in a separate task. Originally, I scheduled the task with
    idle priority, but @sebmarkbage made the good point that if there are
    multiple errors logs, we want to preserve the original order. So I've
    switched it to a microtask. The priority can be lowered in userspace
    by scheduling an additional task inside onRecoverableError.
    
    * Only use host config method for default behavior
    
    Redefines the contract of the host config's logRecoverableError method
    to be a default implementation for onRecoverableError if a user-provided
    one is not provided when the root is created.
    
    * Log with reportError instead of rethrowing
    
    In modern browsers, reportError will dispatch an error event, emulating
    an uncaught JavaScript error. We can do this instead of rethrowing
    recoverable errors in a microtask, which is nice because it avoids any
    subtle ordering issues.
    
    In older browsers and test environments, we'll fall back
    to console.error.
    
    * Naming nits

    When onRecoverableError is not provided to `createRoot`, the
    renderer falls back to a default implementation. Originally I

    [DevTools][Transition Tracing] onTransitionComplete and onTransitionStart implmentation (#23313)
    
    * add transition name to startTransition
    
    Add a transitionName to start transition, store the transition start time and name in the batch config, and pass it to the root on render
    
    * Transition Tracing Types and Consts
    
    * Root begin work
    
    The root operates as a tracing marker that has all transitions on it. This PR only tested the root with one transition so far
    
    - Store transitions in memoizedState. Do this in updateHostRoot AND attemptEarlyBailoutIfNoScheduledUpdate. We need to do this in the latter part because even if the root itself doesn't have an update, it could still have new transitions in its transitionLanes map that we need to process.
    
    * Transition Tracing commit phase
    
    - adds a module scoped pending transition callbacks object that contains all transition callbacks that have not yet been processed. This  contains all callbacks before the next paint occurs.
    - Add code in the mutation phase to:
            * For the root, if there are transitions that were initialized during this commit in the root transition lanes map, add a transition start call to the pending transition callbacks object. Then, remove the transitions from the root transition lanes map.
            * For roots, in the commit phase, add a transition complete call
    
    We add this code in the mutation phase because we can't add it to the passive phase because then the paint might have occurred before we even know which callbacks to call
    
    * Process Callbacks after paint
    
    At the end of the commit phase, call scheduleTransitionCallbacks to schedule all pending transition callbacks to be called after paint. Then clear the callbacks

    Allow updates at lower pri without forcing client render
    
    Currently, if a root is updated before the shell has finished hydrating
    (for example, due to a top-level navigation), we immediately revert to
    client rendering. This is rare because the root is expected is finish
    quickly, but not exceedingly rare because the root may be suspended.
    
    This adds support for updating the root without forcing a client render
    as long as the update has lower priority than the initial hydration,
    i.e. if the update is wrapped in startTransition.
    
    To implement this, I had to do some refactoring. The main idea here is
    to make it closer to how we implement hydration in Suspense boundaries:
    
    - I moved isDehydrated from the shared FiberRoot object to the
    HostRoot's state object.
    - In the begin phase, I check if the root has received an by comparing
    the new children to the initial children. If they are different, we
    revert to client rendering, and set isDehydrated to false using a
    derived state update (a la getDerivedStateFromProps).
    - There are a few places where we used to set root.isDehydrated to false
    as a way to force a client render. Instead, I set the ForceClientRender
    flag on the root work-in-progress fiber.
    - Whenever we fall back to client rendering, I log a recoverable error.
    
    The overall code structure is almost identical to the corresponding
    logic for Suspense components.
    
    The reason this works is because if the update has lower priority than
    the initial hydration, it won't be processed during the hydration
    render, so the children will be the same.
    
    We can go even further and allow updates at _higher_ priority (though
    not sync) by implementing selective hydration at the root, like we do
    for Suspense boundaries: interrupt the current render, attempt hydration
    at slightly higher priority than the update, then continue rendering the
    update. I haven't implemented this yet, but I've structured the code in
    anticipation of adding this later.

    Allow updating dehydrated root at lower priority without forcing client render (#24082)
    
    * Pass children to hydration root constructor
    
    I already made this change for the concurrent root API in #23309. This
    does the same thing for the legacy API.
    
    Doesn't change any behavior, but I will use this in the next steps.
    
    * Add isRootDehydrated function
    
    Currently this does nothing except read a boolean field, but I'm about
    to change this logic.
    
    Since this is accessed by React DOM, too, I put the function in a
    separate module that can be deep imported. Previously, it was accessing
    the FiberRoot directly. The reason it's a separate module is to break a
    circular dependency between React DOM and the reconciler.
    
    * Allow updates at lower pri without forcing client render
    
    Currently, if a root is updated before the shell has finished hydrating
    (for example, due to a top-level navigation), we immediately revert to
    client rendering. This is rare because the root is expected is finish
    quickly, but not exceedingly rare because the root may be suspended.

    support errorInfo in onRecoverableError (#24591)
    
    * extend onRecoverableError API to support errorInfo
    
    errorInfo has been used in Error Boundaries wiht componentDidCatch for a while now. To date this metadata only contained a componentStack. onRecoverableError only receives an error (type mixed) argument and thus providing additional error metadata was not possible without mutating user created mixed objects.
    
    This change modifies rootConcurrentErrors rootRecoverableErrors, and hydrationErrors so all expect CapturedValue types. additionally a new factory function allows the creation of CapturedValues from a value plus a hash and stack.
    
    In general, client derived CapturedValues will be created using the original function which derives a componentStack from a fiber and server originated CapturedValues will be created using with a passed in hash and optional componentStack.

    Bugfix: Revealing a hidden update (#24685)
    
    * Add `isHidden` to OffscreenInstance
    
    We need to be able to read whether an offscreen tree is hidden from
    an imperative event. We can store this on its OffscreenInstance.
    
    We were already scheduling a commit effect whenever the visibility
    changes, in order to toggle the inner effects. So we can reuse that.
    
    * [FORKED] Bugfix: Revealing a hidden update
    
    This fixes a bug I discovered related to revealing a hidden Offscreen
    tree. When this happens, we include in that render all the updates that
    had previously been deferred — that is, all the updates that would have
    already committed if the tree weren't hidden. This is necessary to avoid
    tearing with the surrounding contents. (This was the "flickering"
    Suspense bug we found a few years ago: #18411.)
    
    The way we do this is by tracking the lanes of the updates that were
    deferred by a hidden tree. These are the "base" lanes. Then, in order
    to reveal the hidden tree, we process any update that matches one of
    those base lanes.
    
    The bug I discovered is that some of these base lanes may include
    updates that were not present at the time the tree was hidden. We cannot
    flush those updates earlier that the surrounding contents — that, too,
    could cause tearing.
    
    The crux of the problem is that we sometimes reuse the same lane for
    base updates and for non-base updates. So the lane alone isn't
    sufficient to distinguish between these cases. We must track this in
    some other way.
    
    The solution I landed upon was to add an extra OffscreenLane bit to any
    update that is made to a hidden tree. Then later when we reveal the
    tree, we'll know not to treat them as base updates.
    
    The extra OffscreenLane bit is removed as soon as that lane is committed
    by the root (markRootFinished) — at that point, it gets
    "upgraded" to a base update.
    
    The trickiest part of this algorithm is reliably detecting when an
    update is made to a hidden tree. What makes this challenging is when the
    update is received during a concurrent event, while a render is already
    in progress — it's possible the work-in-progress render is about to
    flip the visibility of the tree that's being updated, leading to a race
    condition.
    
    To avoid a race condition, we will wait to read the visibility of the
    tree until the current render has finished. In other words, this makes
    it an atomic operation. Most of this logic was already implemented
    in #24663.
    
    Because this bugfix depends on a moderately risky refactor to the update
    queue (#24663), it only works in the "new" reconciler fork. We will roll
    it out gradually to www before landing in the main fork.
    
    * Add previous commit to list of forked revisions

    [Transition Tracing] Fix excess calls to the transition start callback (#24806)
    
    This PR fixes a bug where we would add a transition to the lanes map every time an update occurs. However, we didn't factor in that there might be multiple updates in a transition, which would cause the transition to be added multiple times to the transitionLanes map.
    
    This changes the transitionLanes object from an Array of Arrays to an Array of Sets so that we only add a transition if it hasn't been added before, avoiding duplicates

    PR was merged. Need to rebase and fix.

    [Transition Tracing] Code Cleanup (#24880)
    
    This PR cleans up some of the transition tracing code by:
    * Looping through marker transitions only when we process the markerComplete callback (rather than in the commit phase) so we block for less time during commit.
    * Renaming `PendingSuspenseBoundaries` to `pendingBoundaries`
    * Cleaning up the callback functions

    [Transition Tracing] onMarkerIncomplete - Tracing Marker/Suspense Boundary Deletions (#24885)
    
    This PR adds the `onMarkerIncomplete` callback for tracing marker name changes. Specifically, this PR:
    * Adds the `onMarkerIncomplete` callback
    * When a tracing marker is deleted, call `onMarkerIncomplete` with the `name` of the tracing marker for the tracing marker.
    * When a tracing marker/suspense boundary is deleted, call `onMarkerIncomplete` for every parent tracing marker with the `name` of the tracing marker that caused the transition to be incomplete.
    * Don't call `onTransitionComplete` or `onMarkerComplete` when `onMarkerIncomplete` is called for all tracing markers with the same transitions, but continue to call `onTransitionProgress`

    experimental_use(promise) (#25084)
    
    * Internal `act`: Unwrapping resolved promises
    
    This update our internal implementation of `act` to support React's new
    behavior for unwrapping promises. Like we did with Scheduler, when
    something suspends, it will yield to the main thread so the microtasks
    can run, then continue in a new task.
    
    I need to implement the same behavior in the public version of `act`,
    but there are some additional considerations so I'll do that in a
    separate commit.
    
    * Move throwException to after work loop resumes
    
    throwException is the function that finds the nearest boundary and
    schedules it for a second render pass. We should only call it right
    before we unwind the stack — not if we receive an immediate ping and
    render the fiber again.
    
    This was an oversight in 8ef3a7c that I didn't notice because it happens
    to mostly work, anyway. What made me notice the mistake is that
    throwException also marks the entire render phase as suspended
    (RootDidSuspend or RootDidSuspendWithDelay), which is only supposed to
    be happen if we show a fallback. One consequence was that, in the
    RootDidSuspendWithDelay case, the entire commit phase was blocked,
    because that's the exit status we use to block a bad fallback
    from appearing.
    
    * Use expando to check whether promise has resolved
    
    Add a `status` expando to a thrown thenable to track when its value has
    resolved.
    
    In a later step, we'll also use `value` and `reason` expandos to track
    the resolved value.
    
    This is not part of the official JavaScript spec — think of
    it as an extension of the Promise API, or a custom interface that is a
    superset of Thenable. However, it's inspired by the terminology used
    by `Promise.allSettled`.
    
    The intent is that this will be a public API — Suspense implementations
    can set these expandos to allow React to unwrap the value synchronously
    without waiting a microtask.
    
    * Scaffolding for `experimental_use` hook
    
    Sets up a new experimental hook behind a feature flag, but does not
    implement it yet.
    
    * use(promise)
    
    Adds experimental support to Fiber for unwrapping the value of a promise
    inside a component. It is not yet implemented for Server Components,
    but that is planned.
    
    If promise has already resolved, the value can be unwrapped
    "immediately" without showing a fallback. The trick we use to implement
    this is to yield to the main thread (literally suspending the work
    loop), wait for the microtask queue to drain, then check if the promise
    resolved in the meantime. If so, we can resume the last attempted fiber
    without unwinding the stack. This functionality was implemented in
    previous commits.
    
    Another feature is that the promises do not need to be cached between
    attempts. Because we assume idempotent execution of components, React
    will track the promises that were used during the previous attempt and
    reuse the result. You shouldn't rely on this property, but during
    initial render it mostly just works. Updates are trickier, though,
    because if you used an uncached promise, we have no way of knowing
    whether the underlying data has changed, so we have to unwrap the
    promise every time. It will still work, but it's inefficient and can
    lead to unnecessary fallbacks if it happens during a discrete update.
    
    When we implement this for Server Components, this will be less of an
    issue because there are no updates in that environment. However, it's
    still better for performance to cache data requests, so the same
    principles largely apply.
    
    The intention is that this will eventually be the only supported way to
    suspend on arbitrary promises. Throwing a promise directly will
    be deprecated.

    Refactor useEvent (#25336)
    
    * Refactor useEvent
    
    Previously, the useEvent implementation made use of effect infra under
    the hood. This was a lot of extra overhead for functionality we didn't
    use (events have no deps, and no clean up functions). This PR refactors
    the implementation to instead use a queue to ensure that the callback is
    stable across renders.
    
    Additionally, the function signature was updated to infer the callback's argument types and return value. While this doesn't affect anything internal it more accurately describes what's being passed.

    [useEvent] Non-stable function identity (#25473)
    
    * [useEvent] Non-stable function identity
    
    Since useEvent shouldn't go in the dependency list of whatever is
    consuming it (which is enforced by the fact that useEvent functions are
    always locally created and never passed by reference), its identity
    doesn't matter. Effectively, this PR is a runtime assertion
    that you can't rely on the return value of useEvent to be stable.
    
    * Test: Events should see latest bindings
    
    The key feature of useEvent that makes it different from useCallback
    is that events always see the latest committed values. There's no such
    thing as a "stale" event handler.
    
    * Don't queue a commit effect on mount
    
    * Inline event function wrapping
    
    - Inlines wrapping of the callback
    - Use a mutable ref-style object instead of a callable object
    - Fix types

    Rename experimental useEvent to useEffectEvent (#25881)
    
    We originally had grand plans for using this Event concept for more but
    now it's only meant to be used in combination with effects.
    
    It's an Event in the FRP terms, that is triggered from an Effect.
    Technically it can also be from another function that itself is
    triggered from an existing side-effect but that's kind of an advanced
    case.
    
    The canonical case is an effect that triggers an event:
    
    ```js
    const onHappened = useEffectEvent(() => ...);
    useEffect(() => {
      onHappened();
    }, []);
    ```

    ESLint upgrade to use hermes-eslint (#25915)
    
    Hermes parser is the preferred parser for Flow code going forward. We
    need to upgrade to this parser to support new Flow syntax like function
    `this` context type annotations or `ObjectType['prop']` syntax.
    
    Unfortunately, there's quite a few upgrades here to make it work somehow
    (dependencies between the changes)
    
    - ~Upgrade `eslint` to `8.*`~ reverted this as the React eslint plugin
    tests depend on the older version and there's a [yarn
    bug](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/6285) that prevents
    `devDependencies` and `peerDependencies` to different versions.
    - Remove `eslint-config-fbjs` preset dependency and inline the rules,
    imho this makes it a lot clearer what the rules are.
    - Remove the turned off `jsx-a11y/*` rules and it's dependency instead
    of inlining those from the `fbjs` config.
    - Update parser and dependency from `babel-eslint` to `hermes-eslint`.
    - `ft-flow/no-unused-expressions` rule replaces `no-unused-expressions`
    which now allows standalone type asserts, e.g. `(foo: number);`
    - Bunch of globals added to the eslint config
    - Disabled `no-redeclare`, seems like the eslint upgrade started making
    this more precise and warn against re-defined globals like
    `__EXPERIMENTAL__` (in rollup scripts) or `fetch` (when importing fetch
    from node-fetch).
    - Minor lint fixes like duplicate keys in objects.

    Feature: Suspend commit without blocking render (#26398)
    
    This adds a new capability for renderers (React DOM, React Native):
    prevent a tree from being displayed until it is ready, showing a
    fallback if necessary, but without blocking the React components from
    being evaluated in the meantime.
    
    A concrete example is CSS loading: React DOM can block a commit from
    being applied until the stylesheet has loaded. This allows us to load
    the CSS asynchronously, while also preventing a flash of unstyled
    content. Images and fonts are some of the other use cases.
    
    You can think of this as "Suspense for the commit phase". Traditional
    Suspense, i.e. with `use`, blocking during the render phase: React
    cannot proceed with rendering until the data is available. But in the
    case of things like stylesheets, you don't need the CSS in order to
    evaluate the component. It just needs to be loaded before the tree is
    committed. Because React buffers its side effects and mutations, it can
    do work in parallel while the stylesheets load in the background.
    
    Like regular Suspense, a "suspensey" stylesheet or image will trigger
    the nearest Suspense fallback if it hasn't loaded yet. For now, though,
    we only do this for non-urgent updates, like with startTransition. If
    you render a suspensey resource during an urgent update, it will revert
    to today's behavior. (We may or may not add a way to suspend the commit
    during an urgent update in the future.)
    
    In this PR, I have implemented this capability in the reconciler via new
    methods added to the host config. I've used our internal React "no-op"
    renderer to write tests that demonstrate the feature. I have not yet
    implemented Suspensey CSS, images, etc in React DOM. @gnoff and I will
    work on that in subsequent PRs.

    would've seen the actual issue:
    ```
    Cannot return `dispatcher.useEffectEvent(...)` because  `T` [1] is incompatible with  undefined [2].Flow(incompatible-return)
    ```
    
    ## How did you test this change?

    Move update scheduling to microtask (#26512)
    
    When React receives new input (via `setState`, a Suspense promise
    resolution, and so on), it needs to ensure there's a rendering task
    associated with the update. Most of this happens
    `ensureRootIsScheduled`.
    
    If a single event contains multiple updates, we end up running the
    scheduling code once per update. But this is wasteful because we really
    only need to run it once, at the end of the event (or in the case of
    flushSync, at the end of the scope function's execution).
    
    So this PR moves the scheduling logic to happen in a microtask instead.
    In some cases, we will force it run earlier than that, like for
    `flushSync`, but since updates are batched by default, it will almost
    always happen in the microtask. Even for discrete updates.
    
    In production, this should have no observable behavior difference. In a
    testing environment that uses `act`, this should also not have a
    behavior difference because React will push these tasks to an internal
    `act` queue.
    
    However, tests that do not use `act` and do not simulate an actual
    production environment (like an e2e test) may be affected. For example,
    before this change, if a test were to call `setState` outside of `act`
    and then immediately call `jest.runAllTimers()`, the update would be
    synchronously applied. After this change, that will no longer work
    because the rendering task (a timer, in this case) isn't scheduled until
    after the microtask queue has run.
    
    I don't expect this to be an issue in practice because most people do
    not write their tests this way. They either use `act`, or they write
    e2e-style tests.
    
    The biggest exception has been... our own internal test suite. Until
    recently, many of our tests were written in a way that accidentally
    relied on the updates being scheduled synchronously. Over the past few
    weeks, @tyao1 and I have gradually converted the test suite to use a new
    set of testing helpers that are resilient to this implementation detail.
    
    (There are also some old Relay tests that were written in the style of
    React's internal test suite. Those will need to be fixed, too.)
    
    The larger motivation behind this change, aside from a minor performance
    improvement, is we intend to use this new microtask to perform
    additional logic that doesn't yet exist. Like inferring the priority of
    a custom event.

    Implement experimental_useFormStatus (#26722)
    
    This hook reads the status of its ancestor form component, if it exists.
    
    ```js
    const {pending, data, action, method} = useFormStatus();
    ```
    
    It can be used to implement a loading indicator, for example. You can
    think of it as a shortcut for implementing a loading state with the
    useTransition hook.
    
    For now, it's only available in the experimental channel. We'll share
    docs once its closer to being stable. There are additional APIs that
    will ship alongside it.
    
    Internally it's implemented using startTransition + a context object.
    That's a good way to think about its behavior, but the actual
    implementation details may change in the future.
    
    Because form elements cannot be nested, the implementation in the
    reconciler does not bother to keep track of multiple nested "transition
    providers". So although it's implemented using generic Fiber config
    methods, it does currently make some assumptions based on React DOM's
    requirements.

    Implement experimental_useOptimisticState (#26740)
    
    This adds an experimental hook tentatively called useOptimisticState.
    (The actual name needs some bikeshedding.)
    
    The headline feature is that you can use it to implement optimistic
    updates. If you set some optimistic state during a transition/action,
    the state will be automatically reverted once the transition completes.
    
    Another feature is that the optimistic updates will be continually
    rebased on top of the latest state.
    
    It's easiest to explain with examples; we'll publish documentation as
    the API gets closer to stabilizing. See tests for now.
    
    Technically the use cases for this hook are broader than just optimistic
    updates; you could use it implement any sort of "pending" state, such as
    the ones exposed by useTransition and useFormStatus. But we expect
    people will most often reach for this hook to implement the optimistic
    update pattern; simpler cases are covered by those other hooks.

    Detect crashes caused by Async Client Components (#27019)
    
    Suspending with an uncached promise is not yet supported. We only
    support suspending on promises that are cached between render attempts.
    (We do plan to partially support this in the future, at least in certain
    constrained cases, like during a route transition.)
    
    This includes the case where a component returns an uncached promise,
    which is effectively what happens if a Client Component is authored
    using async/await syntax.
    
    This is an easy mistake to make in a Server Components app, because
    async/await _is_ available in Server Components.
    
    In the current behavior, this can sometimes cause the app to crash with
    an infinite loop, because React will repeatedly keep trying to render
    the component, which will result in a fresh promise, which will result
    in a new render attempt, and so on. We have some strategies we can use
    to prevent this — during a concurrent render, we can suspend the work
    loop until the promise resolves. If it's not a concurrent render, we can
    show a Suspense fallback and try again at concurrent priority.
    
    There's one case where neither of these strategies work, though: during
    a sync render when there's no parent Suspense boundary. (We refer to
    this as the "shell" of the app because it exists outside of any loading
    UI.)
    
    Since we don't have any great options for this scenario, we should at
    least error gracefully instead of crashing the app.
    
    So this commit adds a detection mechanism for render loops caused by
    async client components. The way it works is, if an app suspends
    repeatedly in the shell during a synchronous render, without committing
    anything in between, we will count the number of attempts and eventually
    trigger an error once the count exceeds a threshold.
    
    In the future, we will consider ways to make this case a warning instead
    of a hard error.
    
    See https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/26801 for more details.

    Scaffolding for useFormState (#27270)
    
    This exposes, but does not yet implement, a new experimental API called
    useFormState. It's gated behind the enableAsyncActions flag.
    
    useFormState has a similar signature to useReducer, except instead of a
    reducer it accepts an (async) action function. React will wait until the
    promise resolves before updating the state:
    
    ```js
    async function action(prevState, payload) {
      // ..
    }
    const [state, dispatch] = useFormState(action, initialState)
    ```
    
    When used in combination with Server Actions, it will also support
    progressive enhancement — a form that is submitted before it has
    hydrated will have its state transferred to the next page. However, like
    the other action-related hooks, it works with fully client-driven
    actions, too.

    Client implementation of useFormState (#27278)
    
    This implements useFormState in Fiber. (It does not include any
    progressive enhancement features; those will be added later.)
    
    useFormState is a hook for tracking state produced by async actions. It
    has a signature similar to useReducer, but instead of a reducer, it
    accepts an async action function.
    
    ```js
    async function action(prevState, payload) {
      // ..
    }
    const [state, dispatch] = useFormState(action, initialState)
    ```
    
    Calling dispatch runs the async action and updates the state to the
    returned value.
    
    Async actions run before React's render cycle, so unlike reducers, they
    can contain arbitrary side effects.

    submitted before it has hydrated, the permalink will be used as the
    target of the form action, enabling MPA-style form submissions.
    
    (Note that submitting a form without hydration is a feature of Server
    Actions; it doesn't work with regular client actions.)
    
    It does not have any effect after the form has hydrated.

    useFormState: Reuse state from previous form submission (#27321)
    
    If a Server Action is passed to useFormState, the action may be
    submitted before it has hydrated. This will trigger a full page
    (MPA-style) navigation. We can transfer the form state to the next page
    by comparing the key path of the hook instance.
    
    `ReactServerDOMServer.decodeFormState` is used by the server to extract
    the form state from the submitted action. This value can then be passed
    as an option when rendering the new page. It must be passed during both
    SSR and hydration.
    
    ```js
    const boundAction = await decodeAction(formData, serverManifest);
    const result = await boundAction();
    const formState = decodeFormState(result, formData, serverManifest);
    
    // SSR
    const response = createFromReadableStream(<App />);
    const ssrStream = await renderToReadableStream(response, { formState })
    
    // Hydration
    hydrateRoot(container, <App />, { formState });
    ```
    
    If the `formState` option is omitted, then the state won't be
    transferred to the next page. However, it must be passed in both places,
    or in neither; misconfiguring will result in a hydration mismatch.
    
    (The `formState` option is currently prefixed with `experimental_`)

    useFormState: Compare action signatures when reusing form state (#27370)
    
    During an MPA form submission, useFormState should only reuse the form
    state if same action is passed both times. (We also compare the key
    paths.)
    
    We compare the identity of the inner closure function, disregarding the
    value of the bound arguments. That way you can pass an inline Server
    Action closure:
    
    ```js
    function FormContainer({maxLength}) {
      function submitAction(prevState, formData) {
        'use server'
        if (formData.get('field').length > maxLength) {
          return { errorMsg: 'Too many characters' };
        }
        // ...
      }
      return <Form submitAction={submitAction} />
    }

    Add optional initialValue argument to useDeferredValue (#27500)
    
    Adds a second argument to useDeferredValue called initialValue:
    
    ```js
    const value = useDeferredValue(finalValue, initialValue);
    ```
    
    During the initial render of a component, useDeferredValue will return
    initialValue. Once that render finishes, it will spawn an additional
    render to switch to finalValue.
    
    This same sequence should occur whenever the hook is hidden and revealed
    again, i.e. by a Suspense or Activity, though this part is not yet
    implemented.
    
    When initialValue is not provided, useDeferredValue has no effect during
    initial render, but during an update, it will remain on the previous
    value, then spawn an additional render to switch to the new value. (This
    is the same behavior that exists today.)
    
    During SSR, initialValue is always used, if provided.
    
    This feature is currently behind an experimental flag. We plan to ship
    it in a non-breaking release.

    [useFormState] Allow sync actions (#27571)
    
    Updates useFormState to allow a sync function to be passed as an action.
    
    A form action is almost always async, because it needs to talk to the
    server. But since we support client-side actions, too, there's no reason
    we can't allow sync actions, too.
    
    I originally chose not to allow them to keep the implementation simpler
    but it's not really that much more complicated because we already
    support this for actions passed to startTransition. So now it's
    consistent: anywhere an action is accepted, a sync client function is a
    valid input.

    Remove __self and __source location from elements (#28265)
    
    Along with all the places using it like the `_debugSource` on Fiber.
    This still lets them be passed into `createElement` (and JSX dev
    runtime) since those can still be used in existing already compiled code
    and we don't want that to start spreading to DOM attributes.
    
    We used to have a DEV mode that compiles the source location of JSX into
    the compiled output. This was nice because we could get the actual call
    site of the JSX (instead of just somewhere in the component). It had a
    bunch of issues though:
    
    - It only works with JSX.
    - The way this source location is compiled is different in all the
    pipelines along the way. It relies on this transform being first and the
    source location we want to extract but it doesn't get preserved along
    source maps and don't have a way to be connected to the source hosted by
    the source maps. Ideally it should just use the mechanism other source
    maps use.
    - Since it's expensive it only works in DEV so if it's used for
    component stacks it would vary between dev and prod.
    - It only captures the callsite of the JSX and not the stack between the
    component and that callsite. In the happy case it's in the component but
    not always.
    
    Instead, we have another zero-cost trick to extract the call site of
    each component lazily only if it's needed. This ensures that component
    stacks are the same in DEV and PROD. At the cost of worse line number
    information.
    
    The better way to get the JSX call site would be to get it from `new
    Error()` or `console.createTask()` inside the JSX runtime which can
    capture the whole stack in a consistent way with other source mappings.
    We might explore that in the future.
    
    This removes source location info from React DevTools and React Native
    Inspector. The "jump to source code" feature or inspection can be made
    lazy instead by invoking the lazy component stack frame generation. That
    way it can be made to work in prod too. The filtering based on file path
    is a bit trickier.
    
    When redesigned this UI should ideally also account for more than one
    stack frame.
    
    With this change the DEV only Babel transforms are effectively
    deprecated since they're not necessary for anything.

    [Fiber] Transfer `_debugInfo` from Arrays, Lazy, Thenables and Elements to the inner Fibers. (#28286)
    
    That way we can use it for debug information like component stacks and
    DevTools. I used an extra stack argument in Child Fiber to track this as
    it's flowing down since it's not just elements where we have this info
    readily available but parent arrays and lazy can merge this into the
    Fiber too. It's not great that this is a dev-only argument and I could
    track it globally but seems more likely to make mistakes.
    
    It is possible for the same debug info to appear for multiple child
    fibers like when it's attached to a fragment or a lazy that resolves to
    a fragment at the root. The object identity could be used in these
    scenarios to infer if that's really one server component that's a parent
    of all children or if each child has a server component with the same
    name.
    
    This is effectively a public API because you can use it to stash
    information on Promises from a third-party service - not just Server
    Components. I started outline the types for this for some things I was
    planning to add but it's not final.
    
    I was also planning on storing it from `use(thenable)` for when you
    suspend on a Promise. However, I realized that there's no Hook instance
    for those to stash it on. So it might need a separate data structure to
    stash the previous pass over of `use()` that resets each render.
    
    No tests yet since I didn't want to test internals but it'll be covered
    once we have debugging features like component stacks.

    Add pending state to useFormState (#28514)
    
    ## Overview
    
    Adds a `pending` state to useFormState, which will be replaced by
    `useActionState` in the next diff. We will keep `useFormState` around
    for backwards compatibility, but functionally it will work the same as
    `useActionState`, which has an `isPending` state returned.

    Add `React.useActionState` (#28491)
    
    ## Overview
    
    _Depends on https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/28514_
    
    This PR adds a new React hook called `useActionState` to replace and
    improve the ReactDOM `useFormState` hook.
    
    ## Motivation
    
    This hook intends to fix some of the confusion and limitations of the
    `useFormState` hook.
    
    The `useFormState` hook is only exported from the `ReactDOM` package and
    implies that it is used only for the state of `<form>` actions, similar
    to `useFormStatus` (which is only for `<form>` element status). This
    leads to understandable confusion about why `useFormState` does not
    provide a `pending` state value like `useFormStatus` does.
    
    The key insight is that the `useFormState` hook does not actually return
    the state of any particular form at all. Instead, it returns the state
    of the _action_ passed to the hook, wrapping it and returning a
    trackable action to add to a form, and returning the last returned value
    of the action given. In fact, `useFormState` doesn't need to be used in
    a `<form>` at all.
    
    Thus, adding a `pending` value to `useFormState` as-is would thus be
    confusing because it would only return the pending state of the _action_
    given, not the `<form>` the action is passed to. Even if we wanted to
    tie them together, the returned `action` can be passed to multiple
    forms, creating confusing and conflicting pending states during multiple
    form submissions.
    
    Additionally, since the action is not related to any particular
    `<form>`, the hook can be used in any renderer - not only `react-dom`.
    For example, React Native could use the hook to wrap an action, pass it
    to a component that will unwrap it, and return the form result state and
    pending state. It's renderer agnostic.
    
    To fix these issues, this PR:
    - Renames `useFormState` to `useActionState`
    - Adds a `pending` state to the returned tuple
    - Moves the hook to the `'react'` package
    
    ## Reference
    
    The `useFormState` hook allows you to track the pending state and return
    value of a function (called an "action"). The function passed can be a
    plain JavaScript client function, or a bound server action to a
    reference on the server. It accepts an optional `initialState` value
    used for the initial render, and an optional `permalink` argument for
    renderer specific pre-hydration handling (such as a URL to support
    progressive hydration in `react-dom`).
    
    Type:
    
    ```ts
    function useActionState<State>(
            action: (state: Awaited<State>) => State | Promise<State>,
            initialState: Awaited<State>,
            permalink?: string,
        ): [state: Awaited<State>, dispatch: () => void, boolean];
    ```
    
    The hook returns a tuple with:
    - `state`: the last state the action returned
    - `dispatch`: the method to call to dispatch the wrapped action
    - `pending`: the pending state of the action and any state updates
    contained
    
    Notably, state updates inside of the action dispatched are wrapped in a
    transition to keep the page responsive while the action is completing
    and the UI is updated based on the result.
    
    ## Usage
    
    The `useActionState` hook can be used similar to `useFormState`:
    
    ```js
    import { useActionState } from "react"; // not react-dom
    
    function Form({ formAction }) {
      const [state, action, isPending] = useActionState(formAction);
    
      return (
        <form action={action}>
          <input type="email" name="email" disabled={isPending} />
          <button type="submit" disabled={isPending}>
            Submit
          </button>
          {state.errorMessage && <p>{state.errorMessage}</p>}
        </form>
      );
    }
    ```
    
    But it doesn't need to be used with a `<form/>` (neither did
    `useFormState`, hence the confusion):
    
    ```js
    import { useActionState, useRef } from "react";
    
    function Form({ someAction }) {
      const ref = useRef(null);
      const [state, action, isPending] = useActionState(someAction);
    
      async function handleSubmit() {
        // See caveats below
        await action({ email: ref.current.value });
      }
    
      return (
        <div>
          <input ref={ref} type="email" name="email" disabled={isPending} />
          <button onClick={handleSubmit} disabled={isPending}>
            Submit
          </button>
          {state.errorMessage && <p>{state.errorMessage}</p>}
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```
    
    ## Benefits
    
    One of the benefits of using this hook is the automatic tracking of the
    return value and pending states of the wrapped function. For example,
    the above example could be accomplished via:
    
    ```js
    import { useActionState, useRef } from "react";
    
    function Form({ someAction }) {
      const ref = useRef(null);
      const [state, setState] = useState(null);
      const [isPending, setIsPending] = useTransition();
    
      function handleSubmit() {
        startTransition(async () => {
          const response = await someAction({ email: ref.current.value });
          setState(response);
        });
      }
    
      return (
        <div>
          <input ref={ref} type="email" name="email" disabled={isPending} />
          <button onClick={handleSubmit} disabled={isPending}>
            Submit
          </button>
          {state.errorMessage && <p>{state.errorMessage}</p>}
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```
    
    However, this hook adds more benefits when used with render specific
    elements like react-dom `<form>` elements and Server Action. With
    `<form>` elements, React will automatically support replay actions on
    the form if it is submitted before hydration has completed, providing a
    form of partial progressive enhancement: enhancement for when javascript
    is enabled but not ready.
    
    Additionally, with the `permalink` argument and Server Actions,
    frameworks can provide full progressive enhancement support, submitting
    the form to the URL provided along with the FormData from the form. On
    submission, the Server Action will be called during the MPA navigation,
    similar to any raw HTML app, server rendered, and the result returned to
    the client without any JavaScript on the client.
    
    ## Caveats
    There are a few Caveats to this new hook:
    **Additional state update**: Since we cannot know whether you use the
    pending state value returned by the hook, the hook will always set the
    `isPending` state at the beginning of the first chained action,
    resulting in an additional state update similar to `useTransition`. In
    the future a type-aware compiler could optimize this for when the
    pending state is not accessed.
    
    **Pending state is for the action, not the handler**: The difference is
    subtle but important, the pending state begins when the return action is
    dispatched and will revert back after all actions and transitions have
    settled. The mechanism for this under the hook is the same as
    useOptimisitic.
    
    Concretely, what this means is that the pending state of
    `useActionState` will not represent any actions or sync work performed
    before dispatching the action returned by `useActionState`. Hopefully
    this is obvious based on the name and shape of the API, but there may be
    some temporary confusion.
    
    As an example, let's take the above example and await another action
    inside of it:
    
    ```js
    import { useActionState, useRef } from "react";
    
    function Form({ someAction, someOtherAction }) {
      const ref = useRef(null);
      const [state, action, isPending] = useActionState(someAction);
    
      async function handleSubmit() {
        await someOtherAction();
    
        // The pending state does not start until this call.
        await action({ email: ref.current.value });
      }
    
      return (
        <div>
          <input ref={ref} type="email" name="email" disabled={isPending} />
          <button onClick={handleSubmit} disabled={isPending}>
            Submit
          </button>
          {state.errorMessage && <p>{state.errorMessage}</p>}
        </div>
      );
    }
    
    ```
    
    Since the pending state is related to the action, and not the handler or
    form it's attached to, the pending state only changes when the action is
    dispatched. To solve, there are two options.
    
    First (recommended): place the other function call inside of the action
    passed to `useActionState`:
    
    ```js
    import { useActionState, useRef } from "react";
    
    function Form({ someAction, someOtherAction }) {
      const ref = useRef(null);
      const [state, action, isPending] = useActionState(async (data) => {
        // Pending state is true already.
        await someOtherAction();
        return someAction(data);
      });
    
      async function handleSubmit() {
        // The pending state starts at this call.
        await action({ email: ref.current.value });
      }
    
      return (
        <div>
          <input ref={ref} type="email" name="email" disabled={isPending} />
          <button onClick={handleSubmit} disabled={isPending}>
            Submit
          </button>
          {state.errorMessage && <p>{state.errorMessage}</p>}
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```
    
    For greater control, you can also wrap both in a transition and use the
    `isPending` state of the transition:
    
    ```js
    import { useActionState, useTransition, useRef } from "react";
    
    function Form({ someAction, someOtherAction }) {
      const ref = useRef(null);
    
      // isPending is used from the transition wrapping both action calls.
      const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
    
      // isPending not used from the individual action.
      const [state, action] = useActionState(someAction);
    
      async function handleSubmit() {
        startTransition(async () => {
          // The transition pending state has begun.
          await someOtherAction();
          await action({ email: ref.current.value });
        });
      }
    
      return (
        <div>
          <input ref={ref} type="email" name="email" disabled={isPending} />
          <button onClick={handleSubmit} disabled={isPending}>
            Submit
          </button>
          {state.errorMessage && <p>{state.errorMessage}</p>}
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```
    
    A similar technique using `useOptimistic` is preferred over using
    `useTransition` directly, and is left as an exercise to the reader.

    Make onUncaughtError and onCaughtError Configurable (#28641)
    
    Stacked on #28627.
    
    This makes error logging configurable using these
    `createRoot`/`hydrateRoot` options:
    
    ```
    onUncaughtError(error: mixed, errorInfo: {componentStack?: ?string}) => void
    onCaughtError(error: mixed, errorInfo: {componentStack?: ?string, errorBoundary?: ?React.Component<any, any>}) => void
    onRecoverableError(error: mixed, errorInfo: {digest?: ?string, componentStack?: ?string}) => void
    ```
    
    We already have the `onRecoverableError` option since before.
    
    Overriding these can be used to implement custom error dialogs (with
    access to the `componentStack`).
    
    It can also be used to silence caught errors when testing an error
    boundary or if you prefer not getting logs for caught errors that you've
    already handled in an error boundary.
    
    I currently expose the error boundary instance but I think we should
    probably remove that since it doesn't make sense for non-class error
    boundaries and isn't very useful anyway. It's also unclear what it
    should do when an error is rethrown from one boundary to another.
    
    Since these are public APIs now we can implement the
    ReactFiberErrorDialog forks using these options at the roots of the
    builds. So I unforked those files and instead passed a custom option for
    the native and www builds.
    
    To do this I had to fork the ReactDOMLegacy file into ReactDOMRootFB
    which is a duplication but that will go away as soon as the FB fork is
    the only legacy root.

    Track Owner for Server Components in DEV (#28753)
    
    This implements the concept of a DEV-only "owner" for Server Components.
    The owner concept isn't really super useful. We barely use it anymore,
    but we do have it as a concept in DevTools in a couple of cases so this
    adds it for parity. However, this is mainly interesting because it could
    be used to wire up future owner-based stacks.
    
    I do this by outlining the DebugInfo for a Server Component
    (ReactComponentInfo). Then I just rely on Flight deduping to refer to
    that. I refer to the same thing by referential equality so that we can
    associate a Server Component parent in DebugInfo with an owner.
    
    If you suspend and replay a Server Component, we have to restore the
    same owner. To do that, I did a little ugly hack and stashed it on the
    thenable state object. Felt unnecessarily complicated to add a stateful
    wrapper for this one dev-only case.
    
    The owner could really be anything since it could be coming from a
    different implementation. Because this is the first time we have an
    owner other than Fiber, I have to fix up a bunch of places that assumes
    Fiber. I mainly did the `typeof owner.tag === 'number'` to assume it's a
    Fiber for now.
    
    This also doesn't actually add it to DevTools / RN Inspector yet. I just
    ignore them there for now.
    
    Because Server Components can be async the owner isn't tracked after an
    await. We need per-component AsyncLocalStorage for that. This can be
    done in a follow up.

    [Fiber] Use Owner/JSX Stack When Appending Stacks to Console (#29206)
    
    This one should be fully behind the `enableOwnerStacks` flag.
    
    Instead of printing the parent Component stack all the way to the root,
    this now prints the owner stack of every JSX callsite. It also includes
    intermediate callsites between the Component and the JSX call so it has
    potentially more frames. Mainly it provides the line number of the JSX
    callsite. In terms of the number of components is a subset of the parent
    component stack so it's less information in that regard. This is usually
    better since it's more focused on components that might affect the
    output but if it's contextual based on rendering it's still good to have
    parent stack. Therefore, I still use the parent stack when printing DOM
    nesting warnings but I plan on switching that format to a diff view
    format instead (Next.js already reformats the parent stack like this).
    
    __Follow ups__
    
    - Server Components show up in the owner stack for client logs but logs
    done by Server Components don't yet get their owner stack printed as
    they're replayed. They're also not yet printed in the server logs of the
    RSC server.
    
    - Server Component stack frames are formatted as the server and added to
    the end but this might be a different format than the browser. E.g. if
    server is running V8 and browser is running JSC or vice versa. Ideally
    we can reformat them in terms of the client formatting.
    
    - This doesn't yet update Fizz or DevTools. Those will be follow ups.
    Fizz still prints parent stacks in the server side logs. The stacks
    added to user space `console.error` calls by DevTools still get the
    parent stacks instead.
    
    - It also doesn't yet expose these to user space so there's no way to
    get them inside `onCaughtError` for example or inside a custom
    `console.error` override.
    
    - In another follow up I'll use `console.createTask` instead and
    completely remove these stacks if it's available.

    [Fizz] Enable owner stacks for SSR (#30152)
    
    Stacked on #30142.
    
    This tracks owners and their stacks in DEV in Fizz. We use the
    ComponentStackNode as the data structure to track this information -
    effectively like ReactComponentInfo (Server) or Fiber (Client). They're
    the instance.
    
    I then port them same logic from ReactFiberComponentStack,
    ReactFiberOwnerStack and ReactFiberCallUserSpace to Fizz equivalents.
    
    This gets us both owner stacks from `captureOwnerStack()`, as well as
    appended to console.errors logged by Fizz, while rendering and in
    onError.

    Add unstable context bailout for profiling (#30407)
    
    **This API is not intended to ship. This is a temporary unstable hook
    for internal performance profiling.**
    
    This PR exposes `unstable_useContextWithBailout`, which takes a compare
    function in addition to Context. The comparison function is run to
    determine if Context propagation and render should bail out earlier.
    `unstable_useContextWithBailout` returns the full Context value, same as
    `useContext`.
    
    We can profile this API against `useContext` to better measure the cost
    of Context value updates and gather more data around propagation and
    render performance.
    
    The bailout logic and test cases are based on
    https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/20646
    
    Additionally, this implementation allows multiple values to be compared
    in one hook by returning a tuple to avoid requiring additional Context
    consumer hooks.

    [Fiber] Stash ThenableState on the Dependencies Object for Use By DevTools (#30866)
    
    This lets us track what a Component might suspend on from DevTools. We
    could already collect this by replaying a component's Hooks but that
    would be expensive to collect from a whole tree.
    
    The thenables themselves might contain useful information but mainly
    we'd want access to the `_debugInfo` on the thenables which might
    contain additional information from the server.
    
    
    https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/19bd26beb689e554fceb0b929dc5199be8cba594/packages/shared/ReactTypes.js#L114
    
    In a follow up we should really do something similar in Flight to
    transfer `use()` on the debugInfo of that Server Component.

    Schedule prerender after something suspends (#30800)
    
    Adds the concept of a "prerender". These special renders are spawned
    whenever something suspends (and we're not already prerendering).
    
    The purpose is to move speculative rendering work into a separate phase
    that does not block the UI from updating. For example, during a
    transition, if something suspends, we should not speculatively prerender
    siblings that will be replaced by a fallback in the UI until *after* the
    fallback has been shown to the user.

    [Fiber] Optimize enableProfilerCommitHooks by Collecting Elapsed Effect Duration in Module Scope (#30981)
    
    Stacked on #30979.
    
    The problem with the previous approach is that it recursively walked the
    tree up to propagate the resulting time from recording a layout effect.
    
    Instead, we keep a running count of the effect duration on the module
    scope. Then we reset it when entering a nested Profiler and then we add
    its elapsed count when we exit the Profiler.
    
    This also fixes a bug where we weren't previously including unmount
    times for some detached trees since they couldn't bubble up to find the
    profiler.

    Clean up context access profiling experiment (#31806)
    
    We introduced the `unstable_useContextWithBailout` API to run compiler
    based experiments. This API was designed to be an experiment proxy for
    alternative approaches which would be heavier to implement. The
    experiment turned out to be inconclusive. Since most of our performance
    critical usage is already optimized, we weren't able to find a clear win
    with this approach.
    
    Since we don't have further plans for this API, let's clean it up.

    [crud] Narrow resource type (#32203)
    
    Small refactor to the `resource` type to narrow it to an arbitrary
    object or void/null instead of the top type. This makes the overload on
    useEffect simpler since the return type of create is no longer widened
    to the top type when we merge their definitions.

    [crud] Merge useResourceEffect into useEffect (#32205)
    
    Merges the useResourceEffect API into useEffect while keeping the
    underlying implementation the same. useResourceEffect will be removed in
    the next diff.
    
    To fork between behavior we rely on a `typeof` check for the updater or
    destroy function in addition to the CRUD feature flag. This does now
    have to be checked every time (instead of inlined statically like before
    due to them being different hooks) which will incur some non-zero amount
    (possibly negligble) of overhead for every effect.

    Add useSwipeTransition Hook Behind Experimental Flag (#32373)
    
    This Hook will be used to drive a View Transition based on a gesture.
    
    ```js
    const [value, startGesture] = useSwipeTransition(prev, current, next);
    ```
    
    The `enableSwipeTransition` flag will depend on `enableViewTransition`
    flag but we may decide to ship them independently. This PR doesn't do
    anything interesting yet. There will be a lot more PRs to build out the
    actual functionality. This is just wiring up the plumbing for the new
    Hook.
    
    This first PR is mainly concerned with how the whole starts (and stops).
    The core API is the `startGesture` function (although there will be
    other conveniences added in the future). You can call this to start a
    gesture with a source provider. You can call this multiple times in one
    event to batch multiple Hooks listening to the same provider. However,
    each render can only handle one source provider at a time and so it does
    one render per scheduled gesture provider.
    
    This uses a separate `GestureLane` to drive gesture renders by marking
    the Hook as having an update on that lane. Then schedule a render. These
    renders should be blocking and in the same microtask as the
    `startGesture` to ensure it can block the paint. So it's similar to
    sync.
    
    It may not be possible to finish it synchronously e.g. if something
    suspends. If so, it just tries again later when it can like any other
    render. This can also happen because it also may not be possible to
    drive more than one gesture at a time like if we're limited to one View
    Transition per document. So right now you can only run one gesture at a
    time in practice.
    
    These renders never commit. This means that we can't clear the
    `GestureLane` the normal way. Instead, we have to clear only the root's
    `pendingLanes` if we don't have any new renders scheduled. Then wait
    until something else updates the Fiber after all gestures on it have
    stopped before it really clears.

    Add Commit Scaffolding for Gestures (#32451)
    
    This adds a `ReactFiberApplyGesture` which is basically intended to be a
    fork of the phases in `ReactFiberCommitWork` except for the fake commit
    that `useSwipeTransition` does. So far none of the phases are actually
    implemented yet. This is just the scaffolding around them so I can fill
    them in later.
    
    The important bit is that we call `startViewTransition` (via the
    `startGestureTransition` Config) when a gesture starts. We add a paused
    animation to prevent the transition from committing (even if the
    ScrollTimeline goes to 100%). This also locks the documents so that we
    can't commit any other Transitions until it completes.
    
    When the gesture completes (scroll end) then we stop the gesture View
    Transition. If there's no new work scheduled we do that immediately but
    if there was any new work already scheduled, then we assume that this
    will potentially commit the new state. So we wait for that to finish.
    This lets us lock the animation in its state instead of snapping back
    and then applying the real update.
    
    Using this technique we can't actually run a View Transition from the
    current state to the actual committed state because it would snap back
    to the beginning and then run the View Transition from there. Therefore
    any new commit needs to skip View Transitions even if it should've
    technically animated to that state. We assume that the new state is the
    same as the optimistic state you already swiped to. An alternative to
    this technique could be to commit the optimistic state when we cancel
    and then apply any new updates o top of that. I might explore that in
    the future.
    
    Regardless it's important that the `action` associated with the swipe
    schedules some work before we cancel. Otherwise it risks reverting
    first. So I had to update this in the fixture.

    During a Swipe Gesture Render a Clone Offscreen and Animate it Onscreen (#32500)
    
    This is really the essence mechanism of the `useSwipeTransition`
    feature.
    
    We don't want to immediately switch to the destination state when
    starting a gesture. The effects remain mounted on the current state. We
    want the current state to be "live". This is important to for example
    allow a video to keeping playing while starting a swipe (think
    TikTok/Reels) and not stop until you've committed the action. The only
    thing that can be live is the "new" state. Therefore we treat the
    destination as the "old" state and perform a reverse animation from
    there.
    
    Ideally we could apply the old state to the DOM tree, take a snapshot
    and then revert it back in the mutation of `startViewTransition`.
    Unfortunately, the way `startViewTransition` was designed it always
    paints one frame of the "old" state which would lead this to cause a
    flicker.
    
    To work around this, we need to create a clone of any View Transition
    boundary that might be mutated and then render that offscreen. That way
    we can render the "current" state on screen and the "destination" state
    offscreen for the screenshots. Being mutated can be either due to React
    doing a DOM mutation or if a child boundary resizes that causes the
    parent to relayout. We don't have to do this for insertions or deletions
    since they only appear on one side.
    
    The worst case scenario is that we have to clone the whole root. That's
    what this first PR implements. We clone the container and if it's not
    absolutely positioned, we position it on top of the current one. If the
    container is `document` or `<html>` we instead clone the `<body>` tag
    since it's the only one we can insert a duplicate of. If the container
    is deep in the tree we clone just that even though technically we should
    probably clone the whole document in that case. We just keep the impact
    smaller. Ideally though we'd never hit this case. In fact, if we clone
    the document we issue a warning (always for now) since you probably
    should optimize this. In the future I intend to add optimizations when
    affected View Transition boundaries are absolutely positioned since they
    cannot possibly relayout the parent. This would be the ideal way to use
    this feature most efficiently but it still works without it.
    
    Since we render the "old" state outside the viewport, we need to then
    adjust the animation to put it back into the viewport. This is the
    trickiest part to get right while still preserving any customization of
    the View Transitions done using CSS. This current approach reapplies all
    the animations with adjusted keyframes.
    
    In the case of an "exit" the pseudo-element itself is positioned outside
    the viewport but since we can't programmatically update the style of the
    pseudo-element itself we instead adjust all the keyframes to put it back
    into the viewport. If there is no animation on the group we add one.
    
    In the case of an "update" the pseudo-element is positioned on the new
    state which is already inside the viewport. However, the auto-generated
    animation of the group has a starting keyframe that starts outside the
    viewport. In this case we need to adjust that keyframe.
    
    In the future I might explore a technique that inserts stylesheets
    instead of mutating the animations. It might be simpler. But whatever
    hacks work to maximize the compatibility is best.

    Unify BatchConfigTransition and Transition types  (#32783)
    
    This is some overdue refactoring. The two types never made sense. It
    also should be defined by isomorphic since it defines how it should be
    used by renderers rather than isomorphic depending on Fiber.
    
    Clean up hidden classes to be consistent.

    transition tracing callbacks if there's no name since the name is
    required there.

    Solidify addTransitionType Semantics (#32797)
    
    Stacked on #32793.
    
    This is meant to model the intended semantics of `addTransitionType`
    better. The previous hack just consumed all transition types when any
    root committed so it could steal them from other roots. Really each root
    should get its own set. Really each transition lane should get its own
    set.
    
    We can't implement the full ideal semantics yet because 1) we currently
    entangle transition lanes 2) we lack `AsyncContext` on the client so for
    async actions we can't associate a `addTransitionType` call to a
    specific `startTransition`.
    
    This starts by modeling Transition Types to be stored on the Transition
    instance. Conceptually they belong to the Transition instance of that
    `startTransition` they belong to. That instance is otherwise mostly just
    used for Transition Tracing but it makes sense that those would be able
    to be passed the Transition Types for that specific instance.
    
    Nested `startTransition` need to get entangled. So that this
    `addTransitionType` can be associated with the `setState`:
    
    ```js
    startTransition(() => {
      startTransition(() => {
        addTransitionType(...)
      });
      setState(...);
    });
    ```
    
    Ideally we'd probably just use the same Transition instance itself since
    these are conceptually all part of one entangled one. But transition
    tracing uses multiple names and start times. Unclear what we want to do
    with that. So I kept separate instances but shared `types` set.
    
    Next I collect the types added during a `startTransition` to any root
    scheduled with a Transition. This should really be collected one set per
    Transition lane in a `LaneMap`. In fact, the information would already
    be there if Transition Tracing was always enabled because it tracks all
    Transition instances per lane. For now I just keep track of one set for
    all Transition lanes. Maybe we should only add it if a `setState` was
    done on this root in this particular `startTransition` call rather
    having already scheduled any Transition earlier.
    
    While async transitions are entangled, we don't know if there will be a
    startTransition+setState on a new root in the future. Therefore, we
    collect all transition types while this is happening and if a new root
    gets startTransition+setState they get added to that root.
    
    ```js
    startTransition(async () => {
      addTransitionType(...)
      await ...;
      setState(...);
    });
    ```

    This seems like a lot duplication but it's actually ends mostly just
