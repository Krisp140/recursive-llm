# Instructions

You are being benchmarked. You will see the output of a git log command, and from that must infer the current state of a file. Think carefully, as you must output the exact state of the file to earn full marks.

**Important:** Your goal is to reproduce the file's content *exactly* as it exists at the final commit, even if the code appears broken, buggy, or contains obvious errors. Do **not** try to "fix" the code. Attempting to correct issues will result in a poor score, as this benchmark evaluates your ability to reproduce the precise state of the file based on its history.

# Required Response Format

Wrap the content of the file in triple backticks (```). Any text outside the final closing backticks will be ignored. End your response after outputting the closing backticks.

# Example Response

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
print('Hello, world!')
```

    Throw error to warn of mistaken loading of prod + dev React bundles (#10446)
    
    * Throw error to warn of mistaken loading of prod + dev React bundles
    
    **what is the change?:**
    Credit to @gaearon for coming up with a clever way to check for this. :)
    
    I mainly just did the manual testing and fixed a couple of typos in his
    idea.
    
    I'd like to do a follow-up PR to add a link and a page explaining this
    issue more and suggesting how to fix it.
    
    **why make this change?:**
    
    We want to warn for an unfortunate gotcha for
    the following situation -
    1. Wanting to shrink their JS bundle, an engineer runs it through
       'uglifyjs' or some other minifier. They assume this will also do
       dead-code-elimination, but the 'prod' and 'dev' checks are not
       envified yet and dev-only code does not get removed.
    2. Then they run it through browserify's 'envify' or some other tool to
       change all calls to 'process.env.NODE_ENV' to "production". This
       makes their code ready to ship, except the 'dev' only dead code is
       still in the bundle. Their bundle is twice as large as it needs to
       be, due to the dead code.
    
    This was a problem with the old build system before, but with our new
    build system output it's possible to detect and throw an informative
    error in this case.
    
    **test plan:**
    1. run the build in react as usual; `yarn build`
    2. manually run 'uglifyjs -mt' on 'build/packages/react/index.js' to
       simulate mistakenly minifying React before env variables are
       resolved, which skips dead code elimination.
    3. run the fixtures build - `cd fixtures/packaging && node
       ./build-all.js && serve ../..`
    4. Visit just the production browserify fixture -
       http://localhost:5000/fixtures/packaging/browserify/prod/
    5. You should see the error thrown indicating this problem has occurred.
    (Flarnie will insert a screenshot)
    6. Do the above steps with NO uglifyjs step, and verify that no error is
       thrown. When there is no minification applied, we don't assume that
       this mix-up has occurred.
    (Flarnie will insert a screenshot)
    
    **issue:**
    fixes #9589
    
    * Remove extra 'prod' env. check and add link to docs in error message
    
    **what is the change?:**
    Based on helpful feedback from @gaearon
    - removed outer check that `process.env.NODE_ENV` is "production" since
      we are only calling the `testMinification` method inside of another
      check for "production" environment.
    - Added an fburl that points to [our current docs on using the production version of React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/optimizing-performance.html#use-the-production-build)
    
    **why make this change?:**
    To save an extra layer of conditionals and to make the error message
    more clear.
    
    **test plan:**
    Same test plan as earlier -
    
    1. run the build in react as usual; yarn build
    2. manually run 'uglifyjs -mt' on 'build/packages/react/index.js' to
       simulate mistakenly minifying React before env variables are
       resolved, which skips dead code elimination.
    3. run the fixtures build - cd fixtures/packaging && node ./build-all.js && serve ../..
    4. Visit just the production browserify fixture -
       http://localhost:5000/fixtures/packaging/browserify/prod/
       You should see the error thrown indicating this problem has occurred.
       (Flarnie will insert a screenshot in comments on the PR)
    6. Do the above steps with NO uglifyjs step, and verify that no error is thrown. When there is no minification applied, we don't assume that this mix-up has occurred.
    (Flarnie will insert a screenshot in the comments on the PR.)
    
    **issue:**
    https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9589
    
    * WIP fix and test 'testMinificationUsedDCE' method
    
    **what is the change?:**
    - Instead of looking for one match when having the method inspect it's
      own source, we look for two matches, because the search itself will be
      a match.
    - WIP moving this method into another file and testing it.
    
    Next steps:
    - Figure out why the babel.transform call is not actually minifying the
      code
    - Add tests for uglifyjs
    - Update build process so that this file can be accessed from
      `packages/react/index.js`
    
    **why make this change?:**
    - We had a bug in the 'testMinification' method, and I thought the name
      could be more clear. I fixed the code and also changed the name.
    - In order to avoid other bugs and keep this code working in the future
      we'd like to add a unit test for this method. Using the npm modules
      for 'uglifyjs' and 'babel'/'babili' we should be able to actually test
      how this method will work when minified with different configurations.
    
    **test plan:**
    `yarn test`
    
    **issue:**
    https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9589
    
    * Add babeli and uglifyjs as dev-only dependencies
    
    **what is the change?:**
    See commit title
    
    **why make this change?:**
    In order to test that we are correctly detecting different minification
    situations, we are using these modules in a test.
    
    **test plan:**
    NA
    
    **issue:**
    https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9589
    
    * Fix typo and add 'uglifyjs' tests
    
    **what is the change?:**
    There was a mix-up in the conditional in 'testMinificationUsedDCE' and
    this fixes it.
    
    The great new tests we added caught the typo. :)
    
    Next steps:
    - get the tests for 'babili' working
    - update build scripts so that this the 'testMinificationUsedDCE'
      module is available from 'packages/react/index.js'
    
    **why make this change?:**
    We want to modularize 'testMinificationUsedDCE' and test it.
    
    This verifies that the method warns when `uglifyjs` is used to minify
    but dead code elimination is not done, in a production environment.
    Generally this is a 'gotcha' which we want to warn folks aboug.
    
    **test plan:**
    `yarn test src/shared/utils/__tests__/testMinificationUsedDCE-test.js`
    
    **issue:**
    https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9589
    
    * Run prettier
    
    * var -> const/let
    
    * Require specific version of `uglify-js`
    
    **what is the change?:**
    Removed the '^' from the npm package requirement
    
    **why make this change?:**
    I am seeing failures in CI that show `uglify-js` is returning different
    output there from my local environment. To further debug this I'd like
    to run CI with the exact same version of `uglify-js` that I am using
    locally.
    
    **test plan:**
    push and see what CI does
    
    **issue:**
    https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9589
    
    * Add build step copying testMinificationUsedDCE into build/packages/react/cj
    
    **what is the change?:**
    This is a first step - we still need (I think) to process this file to
    get it's contents wrapped in an 'iffe'.
    
    Added a step to the build script which copies the source file for the
    'testMinificationUsedDCE' module into the 'cjs' directory of our react
    package build.
    
    **why make this change?:**
    We want this module to be available to the 'index.js' module in this
    build.
    
    **test plan:**
    Will do manual testing once the build stuff is fully set up.
    
    **issue:**
    
    * Inline 'testMinificationUsedDCE' and remove unit test for now
    
    What:
    - Inlines the 'testMinificationUsedDCE' method into
      'packages/react/index.js'
    - Removes unit test for 'testMinififcationUsedDCE'
    - Puts dependencies back the way that they were; should remove extra
      dependencies that were added for the unit test.
    
    Why:
    - It would add complexity to the build process to add another file to
      the 'build/packages/react/cjs' folder, and that is the only way to
      pull this out and test it. So instead we are inlining this.
    
    * Revert unintentional changes to dependency versions, variable placing
    
    **what is the change?:**
    - We had updated and added some dependencies, but ended up reverting
      this in a previous commit. The `yarn.lock` and `package.json` needed
      updated still though.
    - There is a call to `Function.toString` which we wanted to wrap in a
      `try/catch` block.
    
    **why make this change?:**
    To remove unrelated dependency changes and increase the safety of the
    `Function.toString` call.
    
    **test plan:**
    Manual testing again
    
    **issue:**

    Use Yarn Workspaces (#11252)
    
    * Enable Yarn workspaces for packages/*
    
    * Move src/isomorphic/* into packages/react/src/*
    
    * Create index.js stubs for all packages in packages/*
    
    This makes the test pass again, but breaks the build because npm/ folders aren't used yet.
    I'm not sure if we'll keep this structure--I'll just keep working and fix the build after it settles down.
    
    * Put FB entry point for react-dom into packages/*
    
    * Move src/renderers/testing/* into packages/react-test-renderer/src/*
    
    Note that this is currently broken because Jest ignores node_modules,
    and so Yarn linking makes Jest skip React source when transforming.
    
    * Remove src/node_modules
    
    It is now unnecessary. Some tests fail though.
    
    * Add a hacky workaround for Jest/Workspaces issue
    
    Jest sees node_modules and thinks it's third party code.
    
    This is a hacky way to teach Jest to still transform anything in node_modules/react*
    if it resolves outside of node_modules (such as to our packages/*) folder.
    
    I'm not very happy with this and we should revisit.
    
    * Add a fake react-native package
    
    * Move src/renderers/art/* into packages/react-art/src/*
    
    * Move src/renderers/noop/* into packages/react-noop-renderer/src/*
    
    * Move src/renderers/dom/* into packages/react-dom/src/*
    
    * Move src/renderers/shared/fiber/* into packages/react-reconciler/src/*
    
    * Move DOM/reconciler tests I previously forgot to move
    
    * Move src/renderers/native-*/* into packages/react-native-*/src/*
    
    * Move shared code into packages/shared
    
    It's not super clear how to organize this properly yet.
    
    * Add back files that somehow got lost
    
    * Fix the build
    
    * Prettier
    
    * Add missing license headers
    
    * Fix an issue that caused mocks to get included into build
    
    * Update other references to src/
    
    * Re-run Prettier
    
    * Fix lint
    
    * Fix weird Flow violation
    
    I didn't change this file but Flow started complaining.
    Caleb said this annotation was unnecessarily using $Abstract though so I removed it.
    
    * Update sizes
    
    * Fix stats script
    
    * Fix packaging fixtures
    
    Use file: instead of NODE_PATH since NODE_PATH.
    NODE_PATH trick only worked because we had no react/react-dom in root node_modules, but now we do.
    
    file: dependency only works as I expect in Yarn, so I moved the packaging fixtures to use Yarn and committed lockfiles.
    Verified that the page shows up.
    
    * Fix art fixture
    
    * Fix reconciler fixture
    
    * Fix SSR fixture
    
    * Rename native packages

    Export React as Named Exports instead of CommonJS (#18106)
    
    * Add options for forked entry points
    
    We currently fork .fb.js entry points. This adds a few more options.
    
    .modern.fb.js - experimental FB builds
    .classic.fb.js - stable FB builds
    .fb.js - if no other FB build, use this for FB builds
    .experimental.js - experimental builds
    .stable.js - stable builds
    .js - used if no other override exists
    
    This will be used to have different ES exports for different builds.
    
    * Switch React to named exports
    
    * Export named exports from the export point itself
    
    We need to re-export the Flow exported types so we can use them in our code.
    
    We don't want to use the Flow types from upstream since it doesn't have the non-public APIs that we have.
    
    This should be able to use export * but I don't know why it doesn't work.
    
    This actually enables Flow typing of React which was just "any" before.
    This exposed some Flow errors that needs fixing.
    
    * Create forks for the react entrypoint
    
    None of our builds expose all exports and they all differ in at least one
    way, so we need four forks.
    
    * Set esModule flag to false
    
    We don't want to emit the esModule compatibility flag on our CommonJS
    output. For now we treat our named exports as if they're CommonJS.
    
    This is a potentially breaking change for scheduler (but all those apis
    are unstable), react-is and use-subscription. However, it seems unlikely
    that anyone would rely on this since these only have named exports.
    
    * Remove unused Feature Flags
    
    * Let jest observe the stable fork for stable tests
    
    This lets it do the negative test by ensuring that the right tests fail.
    
    However, this in turn will make other tests that are not behind
    __EXPERIMENTAL__ fail. So I need to do that next.
    
    * Put all tests that depend on exports behind __EXPERIMENTAL__
    
    Since there's no way to override the exports using feature flags
    in .intern.js anymore we can't use these APIs in stable.
    
    The tradeoff here is that we can either enable the negative tests on
    "stable" that means experimental are expected to fail, or we can disable
    tests on stable. This is unfortunate since some of these APIs now run on
    a "stable" config at FB instead of the experimental.
    
    * Switch ReactDOM to named exports
    
    Same strategy as React.
    
    I moved the ReactDOMFB runtime injection to classic.fb.js
    
    Since we only fork the entrypoint, the `/testing` entrypoint needs to
    be forked too to re-export the same things plus `act`. This is a bit
    unfortunate. If it becomes a pattern we can consider forking in the
    module resolution deeply.
    
    fix flow
    
    * Fix ReactDOM Flow Types
    
    Now that ReactDOM is Flow type checked we need to fix up its types.
    
    * Configure jest to use stable entry for ReactDOM in non-experimental
    
    * Remove additional FeatureFlags that are no longer needed
    
    These are only flagging the exports and no implementation details so we
    can control them fully through the export overrides.

    useMutableSource() enables React components to safely and efficiently read from a mutable external source in Concurrent Mode. The API will detect mutations that occur during a render to avoid tearing and it will automatically schedule updates when the source is mutated.

    This PR adds the jsx-runtime and jsx-dev-runtime modules for the JSX Babel Plugin. WWW still relies on jsx/jsxs/jsxDEV from the "react" module, so once we refactor the code to point to the runtime modules we will remove jsx/jsxs/jsxDEV from the "react" module.

    Add useOpaqueIdentifier Hook (#17322)
    
    * Add useOpaqueIdentifier Hook
    
    We currently use unique IDs in a lot of places. Examples are:
      * `<label for="ID">`
      * `aria-labelledby`
    
    This can cause some issues:
      1. If we server side render and then hydrate, this could cause an
         hydration ID mismatch
      2. If we server side render one part of the page and client side
         render another part of the page, the ID for one part could be
         different than the ID for another part even though they are
         supposed to be the same
      3. If we conditionally render something with an ID ,  this might also
         cause an ID mismatch because the ID will be different on other
         parts of the page
    
    This PR creates a new hook `useUniqueId` that generates a different
    unique ID based on whether the hook was called on the server or client.
    If the hook is called during hydration, it generates an opaque object
    that will rerender the hook so that the IDs match.

    Add unstable prefix to experimental APIs (#18825)
    
    We've been shipping unprefixed experimental APIs (like `createRoot` and
    `useTransition`) to the Experimental release channel, with the rationale
    that because these APIs do not appear in any stable release, we're free
    to change or remove them later without breaking any downstream projects.
    
    What we didn't consider is that downstream projects might be tempted to
    use feature detection:
    
    ```js
    const useTransition = React.useTransition || fallbackUseTransition;
    ```
    
    This pattern assumes that the version of `useTransition` that exists in
    the Experimental channel today has the same API contract as the final
    `useTransition` API that we'll eventually ship to stable.
    
    To discourage feature detection, I've added an `unstable_` prefix to
    all of our unstable APIs.
    
    The Facebook builds still have the unprefixed APIs, though. We will
    continue to support those; if we make any breaking changes, we'll
    migrate the internal callers like we usually do. To make testing easier,
    I added the `unstable_`-prefixed APIs to the www builds, too. That way
    our tests can always use the prefixed ones without gating on the
    release channel.

    Expose LegacyHidden type and disable <div hidden /> API in new fork (#18891)
    
    * Expose LegacyHidden type
    
    I will use this internally at Facebook to migrate away from
    <div hidden />. The end goal is to migrate to the Offscreen type, but
    that has different semantics. This is an incremental step.
    
    * Disable <div hidden /> API in new fork
    
    Migrates to the unstable_LegacyHidden type instead. The old fork does
    not support the new component type, so I updated the tests to use an
    indirection that picks the correct API. I will remove this once the
    LegacyHidden (and/or Offscreen) type has landed in both implementations.
    
    * Add gated warning for `<div hidden />` API
    
    Only exists so we can detect callers in www and migrate them to the new
    API. Should not visible to anyone outside React Core team.

    * Add "unstbale_" prefix to mutable source APIs

    This was causing an observable behavioral difference between experimental DEV and PROD builds.
    
    We don't initialize stack position for other composite hooks (e.g. useDeferredValue, useTransition, useOpaqueIdentifier). If we did, it would cause the same obesrvable behavioral difference.

    [Flight] Add getCacheForType() to the dispatcher (#20315)
    
    * Remove react/unstable_cache
    
    We're probably going to make it available via the dispatcher. Let's remove this for now.
    
    * Add readContext() to the dispatcher
    
    On the server, it will be per-request.
    
    On the client, there will be some way to shadow it.
    
    For now, I provide it on the server, and throw on the client.
    
    * Use readContext() from react-fetch
    
    This makes it work on the server (but not on the client until we implement it there.)
    
    Updated the test to use Server Components. Now it passes.
    
    * Fixture: Add fetch from a Server Component
    
    * readCache -> getCacheForType<T>
    
    * Add React.unstable_getCacheForType
    
    * Add a feature flag
    
    * Fix Flow
    
    * Add react-suspense-test-utils and port tests

    [Offscreen] Mount/unmount layout effects (#21386)
    
    * [Offscreen] Mount/unmount layout effects
    
    Exposes the Offscreen component type and implements basic support for
    mount/unmounting layout effects when the visibility is toggled.
    
    Mostly it works the same way as hidden Suspense trees, which use the
    same internal fiber type. I had to add an extra bailout, though, that
    doesn't apply to the Suspense case but does apply to Offscreen
    components: a hidden Offscreen tree will eventually render at low
    priority, and when we it does, its `subtreeTag` will have effects
    scheduled on it. So I added a check to the layout phase where, if the
    subtree is hidden, we skip over the subtree entirely. An alternate
    design would be to clear the subtree flags in the render phase, but I
    prefer doing it this way since it's harder to mess up.
    
    We also need an API to enable the same thing for passive effects. This
    is not yet implemented.

    `act` should work without mock Scheduler (#21714)
    
    Currently, in a React 18 root, `act` only works if you mock the
    Scheduler package. This was because we didn't want to add additional
    checks at runtime.
    
    But now that the `act` testing API is dev-only, we can simplify its
    implementation.
    
    Now when an update is wrapped with `act`, React will bypass Scheduler
    entirely and push its tasks onto a special internal queue. Then, when
    the outermost `act` scope exists, we'll flush that queue.
    
    I also removed the "wrong act" warning, because the plan is to move
    `act` to an isomorphic entry point, simlar to `startTransition`. That's
    not directly related to this PR, but I didn't want to bother
    re-implementing that warning only to immediately remove it.
    
    I'll add the isomorphic API in a follow up.
    
    Note that the internal version of `act` that we use in our own tests
    still depends on mocking the Scheduler package, because it needs to work
    in production. I'm planning to move that implementation to a shared
    (internal) module, too.

    Wire up the native API for useSyncExternalStore (#22237)
    
    Adds useSyncExternalStore to the internal dispatcher, and exports
    the native API from the React package without yet implementing it.

    Add back useMutableSource temporarily (#22396)
    
    Recoil uses useMutableSource behind a flag. I thought this was fine
    because Recoil isn't used in any concurrent roots, so the behavior
    would be the same, but it turns out that it is used by concurrent
    roots in a few places.
    
    I'm not expecting it to be hard to migrate to useSyncExternalStore, but
    to de-risk the change I'm going to roll it out gradually with a flag. In
    the meantime, I've added back the useMutableSource API.

    Initial implementation of cache cleanup (#22510)
    
    This is an initial, partial implementation of a cleanup mechanism for the experimental Cache API. The idea is that consumers of the Cache API can register to be informed when a given Cache instance is no longer needed so that they can perform associated cleanup tasks to free resources stored in the cache. A canonical example would be cancelling pending network requests.
    
    An overview of the high-level changes:
    
    * Changes the `Cache` type from a Map of cache instances to be an object with the original Map of instances, a reference count (to count roughly "active references" to the cache instances - more below), and an AbortController.
    * Adds a new public API, `unstable_getCacheSignal(): AbortSignal`, which is callable during render. It returns an AbortSignal tied to the lifetime of the cache - developers can listen for the 'abort' event on the signal, which React now triggers when a given cache instance is no longer referenced.
      * Note that `AbortSignal` is a web standard that is supported by other platform APIs; for example a signal can be passed to `fetch()` to trigger cancellation of an HTTP request.
    * Implements the above - triggering the 'abort' event - by handling passive mount/unmount for HostRoot and CacheComponent fiber nodes.
    
    Cases handled:
    * Aborted transitions: we clean up a new cache created for an aborted transition
    * Suspense: we retain a fresh cache instance until a suspended tree resolves
    
    For follow-ups:
    * When a subsequent cache refresh is issued before a previous refresh completes, the refreshes are queued. Fresh cache instances for previous refreshes in the queue should be cleared, retaining only the most recent cache. I plan to address this in a follow-up PR.
    * If a refresh is cancelled, the fresh cache should be cleaned up.

    Upgrade useSyncExternalStore to alpha channel (#22662)
    
    * Move useSyncExternalStore shim to a nested entrypoint
    
    Also renames `useSyncExternalStoreExtra` to
    `useSyncExternalStoreWithSelector`.
    
    - 'use-sync-external-store/shim' -> A shim for `useSyncExternalStore`
      that works in React 16 and 17 (any release that supports hooks). The
      module will first check if the built-in React API exists, before
      falling back to the shim.
    - 'use-sync-external-store/with-selector' -> An extended version of
      `useSyncExternalStore` that also supports `selector` and `isEqual`
      options. It does _not_ shim `use-sync-external-store`; it composes the
      built-in React API. **Use this if you only support 18+.**
    - 'use-sync-external-store/shim/with-selector' -> Same API, but it
      composes `use-sync-external-store/shim` instead. **Use this for
      compatibility with 16 and 17.**
    - 'use-sync-external-store' -> Re-exports React's built-in API. Not
      meant to be used. It will warn and direct users to either the shim or
      the built-in API.

    useId (#22644)
    
    * Add useId to dispatcher
    
    * Initial useId implementation
    
    Ids are base 32 strings whose binary representation corresponds to the
    position of a node in a tree.
    
    Every time the tree forks into multiple children, we add additional bits
    to the left of the sequence that represent the position of the child
    within the current level of children.
    
        00101       00010001011010101
        ╰─┬─╯       ╰───────┬───────╯
      Fork 5 of 20       Parent id
    
    The leading 0s are important. In the above example, you only need 3 bits
    to represent slot 5. However, you need 5 bits to represent all the forks
    at the current level, so we must account for the empty bits at the end.
    
    For this same reason, slots are 1-indexed instead of 0-indexed.
    Otherwise, the zeroth id at a level would be indistinguishable from
    its parent.
    
    If a node has only one child, and does not materialize an id (i.e. does
    not contain a useId hook), then we don't need to allocate any space in
    the sequence. It's treated as a transparent indirection. For example,
    these two trees produce the same ids:
    
    <>                          <>
      <Indirection>               <A />
        <A />                     <B />
      </Indirection>            </>
      <B />
    </>
    
    However, we cannot skip any materializes an id. Otherwise, a parent id
    that does not fork would be indistinguishable from its child id. For
    example, this tree does not fork, but the parent and child must have
    different ids.
    
    <Parent>
      <Child />
    </Parent>
    
    To handle this scenario, every time we materialize an id, we allocate a
    new level with a single slot. You can think of this as a fork with only
    one prong, or an array of children with length 1.
    
    It's possible for the the size of the sequence to exceed 32 bits, the
    max size for bitwise operations. When this happens, we make more room by
    converting the right part of the id to a string and storing it in an
    overflow variable. We use a base 32 string representation, because 32 is
    the largest power of 2 that is supported by toString(). We want the base
    to be large so that the resulting ids are compact, and we want the base
    to be a power of 2 because every log2(base) bits corresponds to a single
    character, i.e. every log2(32) = 5 bits. That means we can lop bits off
    the end 5 at a time without affecting the final result.
    
    * Incremental hydration
    
    Stores the tree context on the dehydrated Suspense boundary's state
    object so it resume where it left off.
    
    * Add useId to react-debug-tools
    
    * Add selective hydration test
    
    Demonstrates that selective hydration works and ids are preserved even
    after subsequent client updates.

    experimental_use(promise) (#25084)
    
    * Internal `act`: Unwrapping resolved promises
    
    This update our internal implementation of `act` to support React's new
    behavior for unwrapping promises. Like we did with Scheduler, when
    something suspends, it will yield to the main thread so the microtasks
    can run, then continue in a new task.
    
    I need to implement the same behavior in the public version of `act`,
    but there are some additional considerations so I'll do that in a
    separate commit.
    
    * Move throwException to after work loop resumes
    
    throwException is the function that finds the nearest boundary and
    schedules it for a second render pass. We should only call it right
    before we unwind the stack — not if we receive an immediate ping and
    render the fiber again.
    
    This was an oversight in 8ef3a7c that I didn't notice because it happens
    to mostly work, anyway. What made me notice the mistake is that
    throwException also marks the entire render phase as suspended
    (RootDidSuspend or RootDidSuspendWithDelay), which is only supposed to
    be happen if we show a fallback. One consequence was that, in the
    RootDidSuspendWithDelay case, the entire commit phase was blocked,
    because that's the exit status we use to block a bad fallback
    from appearing.
    
    * Use expando to check whether promise has resolved
    
    Add a `status` expando to a thrown thenable to track when its value has
    resolved.
    
    In a later step, we'll also use `value` and `reason` expandos to track
    the resolved value.
    
    This is not part of the official JavaScript spec — think of
    it as an extension of the Promise API, or a custom interface that is a
    superset of Thenable. However, it's inspired by the terminology used
    by `Promise.allSettled`.
    
    The intent is that this will be a public API — Suspense implementations
    can set these expandos to allow React to unwrap the value synchronously
    without waiting a microtask.
    
    * Scaffolding for `experimental_use` hook
    
    Sets up a new experimental hook behind a feature flag, but does not
    implement it yet.
    
    * use(promise)
    
    Adds experimental support to Fiber for unwrapping the value of a promise
    inside a component. It is not yet implemented for Server Components,
    but that is planned.
    
    If promise has already resolved, the value can be unwrapped
    "immediately" without showing a fallback. The trick we use to implement
    this is to yield to the main thread (literally suspending the work
    loop), wait for the microtask queue to drain, then check if the promise
    resolved in the meantime. If so, we can resume the last attempted fiber
    without unwinding the stack. This functionality was implemented in
    previous commits.
    
    Another feature is that the promises do not need to be cached between
    attempts. Because we assume idempotent execution of components, React
    will track the promises that were used during the previous attempt and
    reuse the result. You shouldn't rely on this property, but during
    initial render it mostly just works. Updates are trickier, though,
    because if you used an uncached promise, we have no way of knowing
    whether the underlying data has changed, so we have to unwrap the
    promise every time. It will still work, but it's inefficient and can
    lead to unnecessary fallbacks if it happens during a discrete update.
    
    When we implement this for Server Components, this will be less of an
    issue because there are no updates in that environment. However, it's
    still better for performance to cache data requests, so the same
    principles largely apply.
    
    The intention is that this will eventually be the only supported way to
    suspend on arbitrary promises. Throwing a promise directly will
    be deprecated.

    Rename experimental useEvent to useEffectEvent (#25881)
    
    We originally had grand plans for using this Event concept for more but
    now it's only meant to be used in combination with effects.
    
    It's an Event in the FRP terms, that is triggered from an Effect.
    Technically it can also be from another function that itself is
    triggered from an existing side-effect but that's kind of an advanced
    case.
    
    The canonical case is an effect that triggers an event:
    
    ```js
    const onHappened = useEffectEvent(() => ...);
    useEffect(() => {
      onHappened();
    }, []);
    ```

    Upgrade prettier (#26081)
    
    The old version of prettier we were using didn't support the Flow syntax
    to access properties in a type using `SomeType['prop']`. This updates
    `prettier` and `rollup-plugin-prettier` to the latest versions.
    
    I added the prettier config `arrowParens: "avoid"` to reduce the diff
    size as the default has changed in Prettier 2.0. The largest amount of
    changes comes from function expressions now having a space. This doesn't
    have an option to preserve the old behavior, so we have to update this.

    Implement experimental_useOptimisticState (#26740)
    
    This adds an experimental hook tentatively called useOptimisticState.
    (The actual name needs some bikeshedding.)
    
    The headline feature is that you can use it to implement optimistic
    updates. If you set some optimistic state during a transition/action,
    the state will be automatically reverted once the transition completes.
    
    Another feature is that the optimistic updates will be continually
    rebased on top of the latest state.
    
    It's easiest to explain with examples; we'll publish documentation as
    the API gets closer to stabilizing. See tests for now.
    
    Technically the use cases for this hook are broader than just optimistic
    updates; you could use it implement any sort of "pending" state, such as
    the ones exposed by useTransition and useFormStatus. But we expect
    people will most often reach for this hook to implement the optimistic
    update pattern; simpler cases are covered by those other hooks.

    rename SuspenseList export to unstable_SuspenseList (#27061)
    
    ## Summary
    
    as we began [discussing
    yesterday](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/27056#discussion_r1253282784),
    `SuspenseList` is not actually stable yet, and should likely be exported
    with the `unstable_` prefix.
    
    the conversation yesterday began discussing this in the context of the
    fb-specific packages, but changing it there without updating everywhere
    else leads to test failures, so here the change is made across packages.
    
    ## How did you test this change?
    
    ```

    [flow] upgrade to 0.225.1 (#27871)
    
    This Flow upgrade includes 2 fixes:
    - Remove `React$StatelessFunctionalComponent` as that was replaced by
    just `React$AbstractComponent` as Flow doesn't make any guarantees, see
    the Flow change here:
    https://github.com/facebook/flow/commit/521317c48f44ffb5eac072a7b2548a72b0745095
    - Flow no longer allows `number` type indexing into objects which
    discovered an incorrect type that is actually an array of the data.
    
    Used this command to upgrade
    ```
    yarn add -W flow-bin flow-remove-types hermes-parser hermes-eslint
    ```
    and ran `yarn flow-ci` to check for errors in different configurations.

    [Flight] Delete Server Context (#28225)
    
    Server Context was never documented, and has been deprecated in
    https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/27424.
    
    This PR removes it completely, including the implementation code.
    
    Notably, `useContext` is removed from the shared subset, so importing it
    from a React Server environment would now should be a build error in
    environments that are able to enforce that.

    Add `React.useActionState` (#28491)
    
    ## Overview
    
    _Depends on https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/28514_
    
    This PR adds a new React hook called `useActionState` to replace and
    improve the ReactDOM `useFormState` hook.
    
    ## Motivation
    
    This hook intends to fix some of the confusion and limitations of the
    `useFormState` hook.
    
    The `useFormState` hook is only exported from the `ReactDOM` package and
    implies that it is used only for the state of `<form>` actions, similar
    to `useFormStatus` (which is only for `<form>` element status). This
    leads to understandable confusion about why `useFormState` does not
    provide a `pending` state value like `useFormStatus` does.
    
    The key insight is that the `useFormState` hook does not actually return
    the state of any particular form at all. Instead, it returns the state
    of the _action_ passed to the hook, wrapping it and returning a
    trackable action to add to a form, and returning the last returned value
    of the action given. In fact, `useFormState` doesn't need to be used in
    a `<form>` at all.
    
    Thus, adding a `pending` value to `useFormState` as-is would thus be
    confusing because it would only return the pending state of the _action_
    given, not the `<form>` the action is passed to. Even if we wanted to
    tie them together, the returned `action` can be passed to multiple
    forms, creating confusing and conflicting pending states during multiple
    form submissions.
    
    Additionally, since the action is not related to any particular
    `<form>`, the hook can be used in any renderer - not only `react-dom`.
    For example, React Native could use the hook to wrap an action, pass it
    to a component that will unwrap it, and return the form result state and
    pending state. It's renderer agnostic.
    
    To fix these issues, this PR:
    - Renames `useFormState` to `useActionState`
    - Adds a `pending` state to the returned tuple
    - Moves the hook to the `'react'` package
    
    ## Reference
    
    The `useFormState` hook allows you to track the pending state and return
    value of a function (called an "action"). The function passed can be a
    plain JavaScript client function, or a bound server action to a
    reference on the server. It accepts an optional `initialState` value
    used for the initial render, and an optional `permalink` argument for
    renderer specific pre-hydration handling (such as a URL to support
    progressive hydration in `react-dom`).
    
    Type:
    
    ```ts
    function useActionState<State>(
            action: (state: Awaited<State>) => State | Promise<State>,
            initialState: Awaited<State>,
            permalink?: string,
        ): [state: Awaited<State>, dispatch: () => void, boolean];
    ```
    
    The hook returns a tuple with:
    - `state`: the last state the action returned
    - `dispatch`: the method to call to dispatch the wrapped action
    - `pending`: the pending state of the action and any state updates
    contained
    
    Notably, state updates inside of the action dispatched are wrapped in a
    transition to keep the page responsive while the action is completing
    and the UI is updated based on the result.
    
    ## Usage
    
    The `useActionState` hook can be used similar to `useFormState`:
    
    ```js
    import { useActionState } from "react"; // not react-dom
    
    function Form({ formAction }) {
      const [state, action, isPending] = useActionState(formAction);
    
      return (
        <form action={action}>
          <input type="email" name="email" disabled={isPending} />
          <button type="submit" disabled={isPending}>
            Submit
          </button>
          {state.errorMessage && <p>{state.errorMessage}</p>}
        </form>
      );
    }
    ```
    
    But it doesn't need to be used with a `<form/>` (neither did
    `useFormState`, hence the confusion):
    
    ```js
    import { useActionState, useRef } from "react";
    
    function Form({ someAction }) {
      const ref = useRef(null);
      const [state, action, isPending] = useActionState(someAction);
    
      async function handleSubmit() {
        // See caveats below
        await action({ email: ref.current.value });
      }
    
      return (
        <div>
          <input ref={ref} type="email" name="email" disabled={isPending} />
          <button onClick={handleSubmit} disabled={isPending}>
            Submit
          </button>
          {state.errorMessage && <p>{state.errorMessage}</p>}
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```
    
    ## Benefits
    
    One of the benefits of using this hook is the automatic tracking of the
    return value and pending states of the wrapped function. For example,
    the above example could be accomplished via:
    
    ```js
    import { useActionState, useRef } from "react";
    
    function Form({ someAction }) {
      const ref = useRef(null);
      const [state, setState] = useState(null);
      const [isPending, setIsPending] = useTransition();
    
      function handleSubmit() {
        startTransition(async () => {
          const response = await someAction({ email: ref.current.value });
          setState(response);
        });
      }
    
      return (
        <div>
          <input ref={ref} type="email" name="email" disabled={isPending} />
          <button onClick={handleSubmit} disabled={isPending}>
            Submit
          </button>
          {state.errorMessage && <p>{state.errorMessage}</p>}
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```
    
    However, this hook adds more benefits when used with render specific
    elements like react-dom `<form>` elements and Server Action. With
    `<form>` elements, React will automatically support replay actions on
    the form if it is submitted before hydration has completed, providing a
    form of partial progressive enhancement: enhancement for when javascript
    is enabled but not ready.
    
    Additionally, with the `permalink` argument and Server Actions,
    frameworks can provide full progressive enhancement support, submitting
    the form to the URL provided along with the FormData from the form. On
    submission, the Server Action will be called during the MPA navigation,
    similar to any raw HTML app, server rendered, and the result returned to
    the client without any JavaScript on the client.
    
    ## Caveats
    There are a few Caveats to this new hook:
    **Additional state update**: Since we cannot know whether you use the
    pending state value returned by the hook, the hook will always set the
    `isPending` state at the beginning of the first chained action,
    resulting in an additional state update similar to `useTransition`. In
    the future a type-aware compiler could optimize this for when the
    pending state is not accessed.
    
    **Pending state is for the action, not the handler**: The difference is
    subtle but important, the pending state begins when the return action is
    dispatched and will revert back after all actions and transitions have
    settled. The mechanism for this under the hook is the same as
    useOptimisitic.
    
    Concretely, what this means is that the pending state of
    `useActionState` will not represent any actions or sync work performed
    before dispatching the action returned by `useActionState`. Hopefully
    this is obvious based on the name and shape of the API, but there may be
    some temporary confusion.
    
    As an example, let's take the above example and await another action
    inside of it:
    
    ```js
    import { useActionState, useRef } from "react";
    
    function Form({ someAction, someOtherAction }) {
      const ref = useRef(null);
      const [state, action, isPending] = useActionState(someAction);
    
      async function handleSubmit() {
        await someOtherAction();
    
        // The pending state does not start until this call.
        await action({ email: ref.current.value });
      }
    
      return (
        <div>
          <input ref={ref} type="email" name="email" disabled={isPending} />
          <button onClick={handleSubmit} disabled={isPending}>
            Submit
          </button>
          {state.errorMessage && <p>{state.errorMessage}</p>}
        </div>
      );
    }
    
    ```
    
    Since the pending state is related to the action, and not the handler or
    form it's attached to, the pending state only changes when the action is
    dispatched. To solve, there are two options.
    
    First (recommended): place the other function call inside of the action
    passed to `useActionState`:
    
    ```js
    import { useActionState, useRef } from "react";
    
    function Form({ someAction, someOtherAction }) {
      const ref = useRef(null);
      const [state, action, isPending] = useActionState(async (data) => {
        // Pending state is true already.
        await someOtherAction();
        return someAction(data);
      });
    
      async function handleSubmit() {
        // The pending state starts at this call.
        await action({ email: ref.current.value });
      }
    
      return (
        <div>
          <input ref={ref} type="email" name="email" disabled={isPending} />
          <button onClick={handleSubmit} disabled={isPending}>
            Submit
          </button>
          {state.errorMessage && <p>{state.errorMessage}</p>}
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```
    
    For greater control, you can also wrap both in a transition and use the
    `isPending` state of the transition:
    
    ```js
    import { useActionState, useTransition, useRef } from "react";
    
    function Form({ someAction, someOtherAction }) {
      const ref = useRef(null);
    
      // isPending is used from the transition wrapping both action calls.
      const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
    
      // isPending not used from the individual action.
      const [state, action] = useActionState(someAction);
    
      async function handleSubmit() {
        startTransition(async () => {
          // The transition pending state has begun.
          await someOtherAction();
          await action({ email: ref.current.value });
        });
      }
    
      return (
        <div>
          <input ref={ref} type="email" name="email" disabled={isPending} />
          <button onClick={handleSubmit} disabled={isPending}>
            Submit
          </button>
          {state.errorMessage && <p>{state.errorMessage}</p>}
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```
    
    A similar technique using `useOptimistic` is preferred over using
    `useTransition` directly, and is left as an exercise to the reader.

    Export captureOwnerStacks() only in DEV "react" builds (#29923)
    
    Only with the enableOwnerStacks flag (which is not on in www).
    
    This is a new DEV-only API to be able to implement what we do for
    console.error in user space.
    
    This API does not actually include the current stack that you'd get from
    `new Error().stack`. That you'd have to add yourself.
    
    This adds the ability to have conditional development exports because we
    plan on eventually having separate ESM builds that use the "development"
    or "production" export conditions.
    
    NOTE: This removes the export of `act` from `react` in prod (as opposed
    to a function that throws) - inline with what we do with other
    conditional exports.

    [flow] Eliminate a few React.Element type that will be synced to react-native (#30719)
    
    ## Summary
    
    Flow will eventually remove the specific `React.Element` type. For most
    of the code, it can be replaced with `React.MixedElement` or
    `React.Node`.
    
    When specific react elements are required, it needs to be replaced with
    either `React$Element` which will trigger a `internal-type` lint error
    that can be disabled project-wide, or use
    `ExactReactElement_DEPRECATED`.
    
    Fortunately in this case, this one can be replaced with just
    `React.MixedElement`.

    [rcr] Re-export useMemoCache in top level React namespace (#31139)
    
    In order to support using the compiler on versions of React prior to 19,
    we need the ability to statically import `c` (aka useMemoCache) or
    fallback to a polyfill supplied by `react-compiler-runtime` (note: this
    is a separate npm package, not to be confused with
    `react/compiler-runtime`, which is currently a part of react).
    
    To do this we first need to re-export `useMemoCache` under the top level
    React namespace again, which is additive and thus non-breaking. Doing so
    allows `react-compiler-runtime` to statically either re-export
    `React.__COMPILER_RUNTIME.c` or supply a polyfill, without the need for
    a dynamic import which is finicky to support due to returning a promise.
    
    In later PRs I will remove `react/compiler-runtime` and update the
    compiler to emit imports to `react-compiler-runtime` instead.

    ## Summary
    
    In order to adopt react 19's ref-as-prop model, Flow needs to eliminate
    all the places where they are treated differently.
    `React.AbstractComponent` is the worst example of this, and we need to
    eliminate it.
    
    This PR eliminates them from the react repo, and only keeps the one that
    has 1 argument of props.

    Add <ViewTransition> Component (#31975)
    
    This will provide the opt-in for using [View
    Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API)
    in React.
    
    View Transitions only trigger for async updates like `startTransition`,
    `useDeferredValue`, Actions or `<Suspense>` revealing from fallback to
    content. Synchronous updates provide an opt-out but also guarantee that
    they commit immediately which View Transitions can't.
    
    There's no need to opt-in to View Transitions at the "cause" side like
    event handlers or actions. They don't know what UI will change and
    whether that has an animated transition described.
    
    Conceptually the `<ViewTransition>` component is like a DOM fragment
    that transitions its children in its own isolate/snapshot. The API works
    by wrapping a DOM node or inner component:
    
    ```js
    import {ViewTransition} from 'react';
    
    <ViewTransition><Component /></ViewTransition>
    ```
    
    The default is `name="auto"` which will automatically assign a
    `view-transition-name` to the inner DOM node. That way you can add a
    View Transition to a Component without controlling its DOM nodes styling
    otherwise.
    
    A difference between this and the browser's built-in
    `view-transition-name: auto` is that switching the DOM nodes within the
    `<ViewTransition>` component preserves the same name so this example
    cross-fades between the DOM nodes instead of causing an exit and enter:
    
    ```js
    <ViewTransition>{condition ? <ComponentA /> : <ComponentB />}</ViewTransition>
    ```
    
    This becomes especially useful with `<Suspense>` as this example
    cross-fades between Skeleton and Content:
    
    ```js
    <ViewTransition>
      <Suspense fallback={<Skeleton />}>
        <Content />
      </Suspense>
    </ViewTransition>
    ```
    
    Where as this example triggers an exit of the Skeleton and an enter of
    the Content:
    
    ```js
    <Suspense fallback={<ViewTransition><Skeleton /></ViewTransition>}>
      <ViewTransition><Content /></ViewTransition>
    </Suspense>
    ```
    
    Managing instances and keys becomes extra important.
    
    You can also specify an explicit `name` property for example for
    animating the same conceptual item from one page onto another. However,
    best practices is to property namespace these since they can easily
    collide. It's also useful to add an `id` to it if available.
    
    ```js
    <ViewTransition name="my-shared-view">
    ```
    
    The model in general is the same as plain `view-transition-name` except
    React manages a set of heuristics for when to apply it. A problem with
    the naive View Transitions model is that it overly opts in every
    boundary that *might* transition into transitioning. This is leads to
    unfortunate effects like things floating around when unrelated updates
    happen. This leads the whole document to animate which means that
    nothing is clickable in the meantime. It makes it not useful for smaller
    and more local transitions. Best practice is to add
    `view-transition-name` only right before you're about to need to animate
    the thing. This is tricky to manage globally on complex apps and is not
    compositional. Instead we let React manage when a `<ViewTransition>`
    "activates" and add/remove the `view-transition-name`. This is also when
    React calls `startViewTransition` behind the scenes while it mutates the
    DOM.
    
    I've come up with a number of heuristics that I think will make a lot
    easier to coordinate this. The principle is that only if something that
    updates that particular boundary do we activate it. I hope that one day
    maybe browsers will have something like these built-in and we can remove
    our implementation.
    
    A `<ViewTransition>` only activates if:
    
    - If a mounted Component renders a `<ViewTransition>` within it outside
    the first DOM node, and it is within the viewport, then that
    ViewTransition activates as an "enter" animation. This avoids inner
    "enter" animations trigger when the parent mounts.
    - If an unmounted Component had a `<ViewTransition>` within it outside
    the first DOM node, and it was within the viewport, then that
    ViewTransition activates as an "exit" animation. This avoids inner
    "exit" animations triggering when the parent unmounts.
    - If an explicitly named `<ViewTransition name="...">` is deep within an
    unmounted tree and one with the same name appears in a mounted tree at
    the same time, then both are activated as a pair, but only if they're
    both in the viewport. This avoids these triggering "enter" or "exit"
    animations when going between parents that don't have a pair.
    - If an already mounted `<ViewTransition>` is visible and a DOM
    mutation, that might affect how it's painted, happens within its
    children but outside any nested `<ViewTransition>`. This allows it to
    "cross-fade" between its updates.
    - If an already mounted `<ViewTransition>` resizes or moves as the
    result of direct DOM nodes siblings changing or moving around. This
    allows insertion, deletion and reorders into a list to animate all
    children. It is only within one DOM node though, to avoid unrelated
    changes in the parent to trigger this. If an item is outside the
    viewport before and after, then it's skipped to avoid things flying
    across the screen.
    - If a `<ViewTransition>` boundary changes size, due to a DOM mutation
    within it, then the parent activates (or the root document if there are
    no more parents). This ensures that the container can cross-fade to
    avoid abrupt relayout. This can be avoided by using absolutely
    positioned children. When this can avoid bubbling to the root document,
    whatever is not animating is still responsive to clicks during the
    transition.
    
    Conceptually each DOM node has its own default that activates the parent
    `<ViewTransition>` or no transition if the parent is the root. That
    means that if you add a DOM node like `<div><ViewTransition><Component
    /></ViewTransition></div>` this won't trigger an "enter" animation since
    it was the div that was added, not the ViewTransition. Instead, it might
    cause a cross-fade of the parent ViewTransition or no transition if it
    had no parent. This ensures that only explicit boundaries perform coarse
    animations instead of every single node which is really the benefit of
    the View Transitions model. This ends up working out well for simple
    cases like switching between two pages immediately while transitioning
    one floating item that appears on both pages. Because only the floating
    item transitions by default.
    
    Note that it's possible to add manual `view-transition-name` with CSS or
    `style={{ viewTransitionName: 'auto' }}` that always transitions as long
    as something else has a `<ViewTransition>` that activates. For example a
    `<ViewTransition>` can wrap a whole page for a cross-fade but inside of
    it an explicit name can be added to something to ensure it animates as a
    move when something relates else changes its layout. Instead of just
    cross-fading it along with the Page which would be the default.
    
    There's more PRs coming with some optimizations, fixes and expanded
    APIs. This first PR explores the above core heuristic.

    Add Transition Types (#32105)
    
    This adds an isomorphic API to add Transition Types, which represent the
    cause, to the current Transition. This is currently mainly for View
    Transitions but as a concept it's broader and we might expand it to more
    features and object types in the future.
    
    ```js
    import { unstable_addTransitionType as addTransitionType } from 'react';
    
    startTransition(() => {
      addTransitionType('my-transition-type');
      setState(...);
    });
    ```
    
    If multiple transitions get entangled this is additive and all
    Transition Types are collected. You can also add more than one type to a
    Transition (hence the `add` prefix).
    
    Transition Types are reset after each commit. Meaning that `<Suspense>`
    revealing after a `startTransition` does not get any View Transition
    types associated with it.
    
    Note that the scoping rules for this is a little "wrong" in this
    implementation. Ideally it would be scoped to the nearest outer
    `startTransition` and grouped with any `setState` inside of it.
    Including Actions. However, since we currently don't have AsyncContext
    on the client, it would be too easy to drop a Transition Type if there
    were no other `setState` in the same `await` task. Multiple Transitions
    are entangled together anyway right now as a result. So this just tracks
    a global of all pending Transition Types for the next Transition. An
    inherent tricky bit with this API is that you could update multiple
    roots. In that case it should ideally be associated with each root.
    Transition Tracing solves this by associating a Transition with any
    updates that are later collected but this suffers from the problem
    mentioned above. Therefore, I just associate Transition Types with one
    root - the first one to commit. Since the View Transitions across roots
    are sequential anyway it kind of makes sense that only one really is the
    cause and the other one is subsequent.
    
    Transition Types can be used to apply different animations based on what
    caused the Transition. You have three different ways to choose from for
    how to use them:
    
    ## CSS
    
    It integrates with [View Transition
    Types](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-view-transitions-2/#active-view-transition-pseudo-examples)
    so you can match different animations based on CSS scopes:
    
    ```css
    :root:active-view-transition-type(my-transition-type) {
      &::view-transition-...(...) {
        ...
      }
    }
    ```
    
    This is kind of a PITA to write though and if you have a CSS library
    that provide View Transition Classes it's difficult to import those into
    these scopes.
    
    ## Class per Type
    
    This PR also adds an object-as-map form that can be passed to all
    `className` properties:
    
    ```js
    <ViewTransition className={{
      'my-navigation-type': 'hello',
      'default': 'world',
    }}>
    ```
    
    If multiple types match, then they're joined together. If no types match
    then the special `"default"` entry is used instead. If any type has the
    value `"none"` then that wins and the ViewTransition is disabled (not
    assigned a name).
    
    These can be combined with `enter`/`exit`/`update`/`layout`/`share`
    props to match based on kind of trigger and Transition Type.
    
    ```js
    <ViewTransition enter={{
      'navigation-back': 'enter-right',
      'navigation-forward': 'enter-left',
    }}
    exit={{
      'navigation-back': 'exit-right',
      'navigation-forward': 'exit-left',
    }}>
    ```
    
    ## Events
    
    In addition, you can also observe the types in the View Transition Event
    callbacks as the second argument. That way you can pick different
    imperative Animations based on the cause.
    
    ```js
    <ViewTransition onUpdate={(inst, types) => {
      if (types.includes('navigation-back')) {
        ...
      } else if (types.includes('navigation-forward')) {
        ...
      } else {
        ...
      }
    }}>
    ```
    
    ## Future
    
    In the future we might expose types to `useEffect` for more general
    purpose usage. This would also allow non-View Transition based
    Animations such as existing libraries to use this same feature to
    coordinate the same concept.
    
    We might also allow richer objects to be passed along here. Only the
    strings would apply to View Transitions but the imperative code and
    effects could do something else with them.
