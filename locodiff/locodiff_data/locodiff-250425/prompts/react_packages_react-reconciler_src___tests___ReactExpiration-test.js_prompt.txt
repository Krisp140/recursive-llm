# Instructions

You are being benchmarked. You will see the output of a git log command, and from that must infer the current state of a file. Think carefully, as you must output the exact state of the file to earn full marks.

**Important:** Your goal is to reproduce the file's content *exactly* as it exists at the final commit, even if the code appears broken, buggy, or contains obvious errors. Do **not** try to "fix" the code. Attempting to correct issues will result in a poor score, as this benchmark evaluates your ability to reproduce the precise state of the file based on its history.

# Required Response Format

Wrap the content of the file in triple backticks (```). Any text outside the final closing backticks will be ignored. End your response after outputting the closing backticks.

# Example Response

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
print('Hello, world!')
```

# File History

    Use Yarn Workspaces (#11252)
    
    * Enable Yarn workspaces for packages/*
    
    * Move src/isomorphic/* into packages/react/src/*
    
    * Create index.js stubs for all packages in packages/*
    
    This makes the test pass again, but breaks the build because npm/ folders aren't used yet.
    I'm not sure if we'll keep this structure--I'll just keep working and fix the build after it settles down.
    
    * Put FB entry point for react-dom into packages/*
    
    * Move src/renderers/testing/* into packages/react-test-renderer/src/*
    
    Note that this is currently broken because Jest ignores node_modules,
    and so Yarn linking makes Jest skip React source when transforming.
    
    * Remove src/node_modules
    
    It is now unnecessary. Some tests fail though.
    
    * Add a hacky workaround for Jest/Workspaces issue
    
    Jest sees node_modules and thinks it's third party code.
    
    This is a hacky way to teach Jest to still transform anything in node_modules/react*
    if it resolves outside of node_modules (such as to our packages/*) folder.
    
    I'm not very happy with this and we should revisit.
    
    * Add a fake react-native package
    
    * Move src/renderers/art/* into packages/react-art/src/*
    
    * Move src/renderers/noop/* into packages/react-noop-renderer/src/*
    
    * Move src/renderers/dom/* into packages/react-dom/src/*
    
    * Move src/renderers/shared/fiber/* into packages/react-reconciler/src/*
    
    * Move DOM/reconciler tests I previously forgot to move
    
    * Move src/renderers/native-*/* into packages/react-native-*/src/*
    
    * Move shared code into packages/shared
    
    It's not super clear how to organize this properly yet.
    
    * Add back files that somehow got lost
    
    * Fix the build
    
    * Prettier
    
    * Add missing license headers
    
    * Fix an issue that caused mocks to get included into build
    
    * Update other references to src/
    
    * Re-run Prettier
    
    * Fix lint
    
    * Fix weird Flow violation
    
    I didn't change this file but Flow started complaining.
    Caleb said this annotation was unnecessarily using $Abstract though so I removed it.
    
    * Update sizes
    
    * Fix stats script
    
    * Fix packaging fixtures
    
    Use file: instead of NODE_PATH since NODE_PATH.
    NODE_PATH trick only worked because we had no react/react-dom in root node_modules, but now we do.
    
    file: dependency only works as I expect in Yarn, so I moved the packaging fixtures to use Yarn and committed lockfiles.
    Verified that the page shows up.
    
    * Fix art fixture
    
    * Fix reconciler fixture
    
    * Fix SSR fixture
    
    * Rename native packages

commit 94518b068bf52196abea0c83f4c9926bfe2065c6
Author: Andrew Clark <acdlite@me.com>

    Add stack unwinding phase for handling errors (#12201)
    
    * Add stack unwinding phase for handling errors
    
    A rewrite of error handling, with semantics that more closely match
    stack unwinding.
    
    Errors that are thrown during the render phase unwind to the nearest
    error boundary, like before. But rather than synchronously unmount the
    children before retrying, we restart the failed subtree within the same
    render phase. The failed children are still unmounted (as if all their
    keys changed) but without an extra commit.
    
    Commit phase errors are different. They work by scheduling an error on
    the update queue of the error boundary. When we enter the render phase,
    the error is popped off the queue. The rest of the algorithm is
    the same.
    
    This approach is designed to work for throwing non-errors, too, though
    that feature is not implemented yet.
    
    * Add experimental getDerivedStateFromCatch lifecycle
    
    Fires during the render phase, so you can recover from an error within the same
    pass. This aligns error boundaries more closely with try-catch semantics.
    
    Let's keep this behind a feature flag until a future release. For now, the
    recommendation is to keep using componentDidCatch. Eventually, the advice will
    be to use getDerivedStateFromCatch for handling errors and componentDidCatch
    only for logging.
    
    * Reconcile twice to remount failed children, instead of using a boolean
    
    * Handle effect immediately after its thrown
    
    This way we don't have to store the thrown values on the effect list.
    
    * ReactFiberIncompleteWork -> ReactFiberUnwindWork
    
    * Remove startTime
    
    * Remove TypeOfException
    
    We don't need it yet. We'll reconsider once we add another exception type.
    
    * Move replay to outer catch block
    
    This moves it out of the hot path.

    Always batch updates of like priority within the same event (#13071)
    
    Expiration times are computed by adding to the current time (the start
    time). However, if two updates are scheduled within the same event, we
    should treat their start times as simultaneous, even if the actual clock
    time has advanced between the first and second call.
    
    In other words, because expiration times determine how updates are
    batched, we want all updates of like priority that occur within the same
    event to receive the same expiration time. Otherwise we get tearing.
    
    We keep track of two separate times: the current "renderer" time and the
    current "scheduler" time. The renderer time can be updated whenever; it
    only exists to minimize the calls performance.now.
    
    But the scheduler time can only be updated if there's no pending work,
    or if we know for certain that we're not in the middle of an event.

    Port more tests to the Scheduler.unstable_yieldValue pattern and drop internal.js (#18549)
    
    * Drop the .internal.js suffix on some files that don't need it anymore
    
    * Port some ops patterns to scheduler yield
    
    * Fix triangle test to avoid side-effects in constructor
    
    * Move replaying of setState updaters until after the effect
    
    Otherwise any warnings get silenced if they're deduped.
    
    * Drop .internal.js in more files
    
    * Don't check propTypes on a simple memo component unless it's lazy
    
    Comparing the elementType doesn't work for this because it will never be
    the same for a simple element.
    
    This caused us to double validate these. This was covered up because in
    internal tests this was deduped since they shared the prop types cache
    but since we now inline it, it doesn't get deduped.

commit db6513914f99c260090f26f0a547ee1432c934e6

    Make ExpirationTime an opaque type (#18732)
    
    * Add LanePriority type
    
    React's internal scheduler has more priority levels than the external
    Scheduler package. Let's use React as the source of truth for tracking
    the priority of updates so we have more control. We'll still fall back
    to Scheduler in the default case. In the future, we should consider
    removing `runWithPriority` from Scheduler and replacing the valid use
    cases with React-specific APIs.
    
    This commit adds a new type, called a LanePriority to disambiguate from
    the Scheduler one.
    
    ("Lane" refers to another type that I'm planning. It roughly translates
    to "thread." Each lane will have a priority associated with it.)
    
    I'm not actually using the lane anywhere, yet. Only setting stuff up.
    
    * Remove expiration times train model
    
    In the old reconciler, expiration times are computed by applying an
    offset to the current system time. This has the effect of increasing
    the priority of updates as time progresses. Because we also use
    expiration times as a kind of "thread" identifier, it turns out this
    is quite limiting because we can only flush work sequentially along
    the timeline.
    
    The new model will use a bitmask to represent parallel threads that
    can be worked on in any combination and in any order.
    
    In this commit, expiration times and the linear timeline are still in
    place, but they are no longer based on a timestamp. Effectively, they
    are constants based on their priority level.
    
    * Stop using ExpirationTime to represent timestamps
    
    Follow up to the previous commit. This converts the remaining places
    where we were using the ExpirationTime type to represent a timestamp,
    like Suspense timeouts.
    
    * Fork Dependencies and PendingInteractionMap types
    
    These contain expiration times
    
    * Make ExpirationTime an opaque type
    
    ExpirationTime is currently just an alias for the `number` type, for a
    few reasons. One is that it predates Flow's opaque type feature. Another
    is that making it opaque means we have to move all our comparisons and
    number math to the ExpirationTime module, and use utility functions
    everywhere else.
    
    However, this is actually what we want in the new system, because the
    Lanes type that will replace ExpirationTime is a bitmask with a
    particular layout, and performing operations on it will involve more
    than just number comparisions and artihmetic. I don't want this logic to
    spread ad hoc around the whole codebase.
    
    The utility functions get inlined by Closure so it doesn't matter
    performance-wise.
    
    I automated most of the changes with JSCodeshift, with only a few manual
    tweaks to stuff like imports. My goal was to port the logic exactly to
    prevent subtle mistakes, without trying to simplify anything in the
    process. I'll likely need to audit many of these sites again when I
    replace them with the new type, though, especially the ones
    in ReactFiberRoot.
    
    I added the codemods I used to the `scripts` directory. I won't merge
    these to master. I'll remove them in a subsequent commit. I'm only
    committing them here so they show up in the PR for future reference.
    
    I had a lot of trouble getting Flow to pass. Somehow it was not
    inferring the correct type of the constants exported from the
    ExpirationTime module, despite being annotated correctly.
    
    I tried converting them them to constructor functions — `NoWork`
    becomes `NoWork()` — and that made it work. I used that to unblock me,
    and fixed all the other type errors. Once there were no more type
    errors, I tried converting the constructors back to constants. Started
    getting errors again.
    
    Then I added a type constraint everywhere a constant was referenced.
    That fixed it. I also figured out that you only have to add a constraint
    when the constant is passed to another function, even if the function is
    annotated. So this indicates to me that it's probably a Flow bug. I'll
    file an issue with Flow.
    
    * Delete temporary codemods used in previous commit
    
    I only added these to the previous commit so that I can easily run it
    again when rebasing. When the stack is squashed, it will be as if they
    never existed.

    Detect and prevent render starvation, per lane (#18864)
    
    * Detect and prevent render starvation, per lane
    
    If an update is CPU-bound for longer than expected according to its
    priority, we assume it's being starved by other work on the main thread.
    
    To detect this, we keep track of the elapsed time using a fixed-size
    array where each slot corresponds to a lane. What we actually store is
    the event time when the lane first became CPU-bound.
    
    Then, when receiving a new update or yielding to the main thread, we
    check how long each lane has been pending. If the time exceeds a
    threshold constant corresponding to its priority, we mark it as expired
    to force it to synchronously finish.
    
    We don't want to mistake time elapsed while an update is IO-bound
    (waiting for data to resolve) for time when it is CPU-bound. So when a
    lane suspends, we clear its associated event time from the array. When
    it receives a signal to try again, either a ping or an update, we assign
    a new event time to restart the clock.
    
    * Store as expiration time, not start time
    
    I originally stored the start time because I thought I could use this
    in the future to also measure Suspense timeouts. (Event times are
    currently stored on each update object for this purpose.) But that
    won't work because in the case of expiration times, we reset the clock
    whenever the update becomes IO-bound. So to replace the per-update
    field, I'm going to have to track those on the room separately from
    expiration times.

    Land Lanes implementation in old fork (#19108)
    
    * Add autofix to cross-fork lint rule
    
    * replace-fork: Replaces old fork contents with new
    
    For each file in the new fork, copies the contents into the
    corresponding file of the old fork, replacing what was already there.
    
    In contrast to merge-fork, which performs a three-way merge.
    
    * Replace old fork contents with new fork
    
    First I ran  `yarn replace-fork`.
    
    Then I ran `yarn lint` with autofix enabled. There's currently no way to
    do that from the command line (we should fix that), so I had to edit the
    lint script file.
    
    * Manual fix-ups
    
    Removes dead branches, removes prefixes from internal fields.  Stuff
    like that.
    
    * Fix DevTools tests
    
    DevTools tests only run against the old fork, which is why I didn't
    catch these earlier.
    
    There is one test that is still failing. I'm fairly certain it's related
    to the layout of the Suspense fiber: we no longer conditionally wrap the
    primary children. They are always wrapped in an extra fiber.
    
    Since this has been running in www for weeks without major issues, I'll
    defer fixing the remaining test to a follow up.

commit d13f5b9538e48f74f7c571ef3cde652ca887cca0
Author: Andrew Clark <git@andrewclark.io>

    Experiment: Unsuspend all lanes on update (#20660)
    
    Adds a feature flag to tweak the internal heuristic used to "unsuspend"
    lanes when a new update comes in.
    
    A lane is "suspended" if we couldn't finish rendering it because it was
    missing data, and we chose not to commit the fallback. (In this context,
    "suspended" does not include updates that finished with a fallback.)
    
    When we receive new data in the form of an update, we need to retry
    rendering the suspended lanes, since the new data may have unblocked the
    previously suspended work. For example, the new update could navigate
    back to an already loaded route.
    
    It's impractical to retry every combination of suspended lanes, so we
    need some heuristic that decides which lanes to retry and in
    which order.
    
    The existing heuristic roughly approximates the old Expiration Times
    model. It unsuspends all lower priority lanes, but leaves higher
    priority lanes suspended.
    
    Then when we start rendering, we choose the lanes that have the highest
    LanePriority and render those -- and then we add to that all the lanes
    that are highher priority.
    
    If this sounds terribly confusing, it's because it barely makes sense.
    (It made more sense in the Expiration Times world, I promise, but it
    was still confusing.) I don't think it's worth me trying to explain the
    old behavior too much because the point here is that we can replace it
    with something simpler.
    
    The new heurstic is to unsuspend all suspended lanes whenever there's
    an update.
    
    This is effectively what we already do except in a few very specific
    edge cases, ever since we removed the delayed suspense feature from
    everything that's not a refresh transition.
    
    We can optimize this in the future to only unsuspend lanes that are
    either 1) in the `lanes` or `subtreeLanes` of the node that was updated,
    or 2) in the `lanes` of the return path of the node that was updated.
    This would exclude lanes that are only located in unrelated sibling
    trees. But, this optimization wouldn't be useful currently because we
    assign the same transition lane to all transitions. It will become
    relevant again once we start assigning arbitrary lanes to transitions
    -- but that in turn requires us to implement entanglement of overlapping
    transitions, one of our planned projects.
    
    So to sum up: the goal here is to remove the weird edge cases and switch
    to a simpler model, on top of which we can make more substantial
    improvements.
    
    I put it behind a flag so I can run an A/B test and confirm it doesn't
    cause a regression.

    Parallel transitions: Assign different lanes to consecutive transitions (#20672)
    
    * Land enableTransitionEntanglement changes
    
    Leaving the flag though because I plan to reuse it for additional,
    similar changes.
    
    * Assign different lanes to consecutive transitions
    
    Currently we always assign the same lane to all transitions. This means
    if there are two pending transitions at the same time, neither
    transition can finish until both can finish, even if they affect
    completely separate parts of the UI.
    
    The new approach is to assign a different lane to each consecutive
    transition, by shifting the bit to the right each time. When we reach
    the end of the bit range, we cycle back to the first bit. In practice,
    this should mean that all transitions get their own dedicated lane,
    unless we have more pending transitions than lanes, which should
    be rare.
    
    We retain our existing behavior of assigning the same lane to all
    transitions within the same event. This is achieved by caching the first
    lane assigned to a transition, then re-using that one until the next
    React task, by which point the event must have finished. This preserves
    the guarantee that all transition updates that result from a single
    event will be consistent.

commit 6c526c5153bc350d2a62c7dcbc698be77d3f2439

    Don't shift interleaved updates to separate lane (#20681)
    
    Now that interleaved updates are added to a special queue, we no longer
    need to shift them into their own lane. We can add to a lane that's
    already in the middle of rendering without risk of tearing.
    
    See #20615 for more background.
    
    I've only changed this in the new fork, and only behind the
    enableTransitionEntanglements flag.
    
    Most of this commit involves updating tests. The "shift-to-a-new" lane
    trick was intentionally used in a handful of tests where two or more
    updates need to be scheduled in different lanes. Most of these tests
    were written before `startTransition` existed, and all of them were
    written before transitions were assigned arbitrary lanes.
    
    So I ported these tests to use `startTransition` instead, which is the
    idiomatic way to mark an update as parallel.
    
    I didn't change the old fork at all. Writing these tests in such a way
    that they also pass in the old fork actually revealed a few flaws in the
    current implementation regarding interrupting a suspended refresh
    transition early, which is a good reminder that we should be writing our
    tests using idiomatic patterns as much as we possibly can.

    Apply #20778 to new fork, too (#20782)
    
    * Apply #20778 to new fork, too
    
    * Fix tests that use runWithPriority
    
    Where possible, I tried to rewrite in terms of an idiomatic API.
    
    For DOM tests, we should be dispatching an event with the desired
    priority level.
    
    For Idle updates (very unstable feature), probably need an unstable
    API like ReactDOM.unstable_IdleUpdates.
    
    Some of these fixes are not great, but we can replace them once we've
    landed the more of our planned changes to the layering between
    Scheduler, the reconciler, and the renderer.

    Entangled expired lanes with SyncLane (#21083)
    
    Makes the implementation simpler. Expiration is now a special case of
    entanglement.
    
    Also fixes an issue where expired lanes weren't batched with normal
    sync updates. (See deleted TODO comment in test.)

    Use performConcurrentWorkOnRoot for "sync default" (#21322)
    
    Instead of `performSyncWorkOnRoot`.
    
    The conceptual model is that the only difference between sync default
    updates (in React 18) and concurrent default updates (in a future major
    release) is time slicing. All other behavior should be the same
    (i.e. the stuff in `finishConcurrentRender`).
    
    Given this, I think it makes more sense to model the implementation this
    way, too. This exposed a quirk in the previous implementation where
    non-sync work was sometimes mistaken for sync work and flushed too
    early. In the new implementation, `performSyncWorkOnRoot` is only used
    for truly synchronous renders (i.e. `SyncLane`), which should make these
    mistakes less common.
    
    Fixes most of the tests marked with TODOs from #21072.

commit 48740429b4a74e984193e4e2d364d461e4fdc3be

    Expiration: Do nothing except disable time slicing (#21345)
    
    We have a feature called "expiration" whose purpose is to prevent
    a concurrent update from being starved by higher priority events.
    If a lane is CPU-bound for too long, we finish the rest of the work
    synchronously without allowing further interruptions.
    
    In the current implementation, we do this in sort of a roundabout way:
    once a lane is determined to have expired, we entangle it with SyncLane
    and switch to the synchronous work loop.
    
    There are a few flaws with the approach. One is that SyncLane has a
    particular semantic meaning besides its non-yieldiness. For example,
    `flushSync` will force remaining Sync work to finish; currently, that
    also includes expired work, which isn't an intended behavior, but rather
    an artifact of the implementation.
    
    An event worse example is that passive effects triggered by a Sync
    update are flushed synchronously, before paint, so that its result
    is guaranteed to be observed by the next discrete event. But expired
    work has no such requirement: we're flushing expired effects before
    paint unnecessarily.
    
    Aside from the behaviorial implications, the current implementation has
    proven to be fragile: more than once, we've accidentally regressed
    performance due to a subtle change in how expiration is handled.
    
    This PR aims to radically simplify how we model starvation protection by
    scaling back the implementation as much as possible. In this new model,
    if a lane is expired, we disable time slicing. That's it. We don't
    entangle it with SyncLane. The only thing we do is skip the call to
    `shouldYield` in between each time slice. This is identical to how we
    model synchronous-by-default updates in React 18.

commit d7dce572c7453737a685e791e7afcbc7e2b2fe16

    Remove internal `act` builds from public modules (#21721)
    
    * Move internal version of act to shared module
    
    No reason to have three different copies of this anymore.
    
    I've left the the renderer-specific `act` entry points because legacy
    mode tests need to also be wrapped in `batchedUpdates`. Next, I'll update
    the tests to use `batchedUpdates` manually when needed.
    
    * Migrates tests to use internal module directly
    
    Instead of the `unstable_concurrentAct` exports. Now we can drop those
    from the public builds.
    
    I put it in the jest-react package since that's where we put our other
    testing utilities (like `toFlushAndYield`). Not so much so it can be
    consumed publicly (nobody uses that package except us), but so it works
    with our build tests.
    
    * Remove unused internal fields
    
    These were used by the old act implementation. No longer needed.

    Batch sync, default and continuous lanes (#25700)
    
    <!--
      Thanks for submitting a pull request!
    We appreciate you spending the time to work on these changes. Please
    provide enough information so that others can review your pull request.
    The three fields below are mandatory.
    
    Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is
    done:
    
    1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create
    your branch from `main`.
      2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.
    3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!
    4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch
    TestName` is helpful in development.
    5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It
    supports the same options as `yarn test`.
    6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn debug-test --watch TestName`, open
    `chrome://inspect`, and press "Inspect".
    7. Format your code with
    [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).
    8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only
    check changed files.
      9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type checks (`yarn flow`).
      10. If you haven't already, complete the CLA.

    ## Summary
    
    <!--
    Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem
    does the pull request solve?
    -->
    This is the other approach for unifying default and sync lane
    https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/25524.
    The approach in that PR is to merge default and continuous lane into the
    sync lane, and use a new field to track the priority. But there are a
    couple places that field will be needed, and it is difficult to
    correctly reset the field when there is no sync lane.
    
    In this PR we take the other approach that doesn't remove any lane, but
    batch them to get the behavior we want.
    
    
    ## How did you test this change?
    
    <!--
    Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and
    their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user
    interface.
    How exactly did you verify that your PR solves the issue you wanted to
    solve?
      If you leave this empty, your PR will very likely be closed.

    Prefer JSX in ReactNoop assertions (to combat out-of-memory test runs) (#26127)
    
    ## Summary
    
    Prefer `getChildrenAsJSX` or `toMatchRenderedOutput` over `getChildren`.
    Use `dangerouslyGetChildren` if you really need to (e.g. for `toBe`
    assertions).
    
    Prefer `getPendingChildrenAsJSX` over `getPendingChildren`. Use
    `dangerouslyGetPendingChildren` if you really need to (e.g. for `toBe`
    assertions).
    
    `ReactNoop.getChildren` contains the fibers as non-enumerable
    properties. If you pass the children to `toEqual` and have a mismatch,
    Jest performance is very poor (to the point of causing out-of-memory
    crashes e.g.
    https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/facebook/react/38084/workflows/02ca0cbb-bab4-4c19-8d7d-ada814eeebb9/jobs/624297/parallel-runs/5?filterBy=ALL&invite=true#step-106-27).
    Mismatches can sometimes be intended e.g. on gated tests.
    
    Instead, I converted almost all of the `toEqual` assertions to
    `toMatchRenderedOutput` assertions or compare the JSX instead. For
    ReactNoopPersistent we still use `getChildren` since we have assertions
    on referential equality. `toMatchRenderedOutput` is more accurate in
    some instances anyway. I highlighted some of those more accurate
    assertions in review-comments.
    
    ## How did you test this change?
    
    - [x] `CIRCLE_NODE_TOTAL=20 CIRCLE_NODE_INDEX=5 yarn test
    -r=experimental --env=development --ci`: Can take up to 350s (and use up
    to 7GB of memory) on `main` but 11s on this branch
    - [x] No more slow `yarn test` parallel runs of `yarn_test` jobs (the
    steps in these runs should take <1min but sometimes they take 3min and
    end with OOM like

commit 25a8b9735ce7c84210707d5eced7fe2c9abbd0e1
Author: Andrew Clark <git@andrewclark.io>
Date:   Thu Mar 2 22:34:58 2023 -0500

    Codemod tests to waitFor pattern (1/?) (#26288)
    
    This converts some of our test suite to use the `waitFor` test pattern,
    instead of the `expect(Scheduler).toFlushAndYield` pattern. Most of
    these changes are automated with jscodeshift, with some slight manual
    cleanup in certain cases.
    
    See #26285 for full context.

    The codemod I used in #26288 accidentally caused some comments to be
    deleted. Because not all affected lines included comments, I didn't
    notice until after landing.
    
    This adds the comments back.

    (This only affects our own internal repo; it's not a public API.)
    
    I think most of us agree this is a less confusing name. It's possible
    someone will confuse it with `console.log`. If that becomes a problem we
    can warn in dev or something.

    This is not a public API. We only use it for our internal tests, the
    ones in this repo. Let's move it to this private package. Practically
    speaking this will also let us use async/await in the implementation.

    Codemod redundant async act scopes (#26350)
    
    Prior to #26347, our internal `act` API (not the public API) behaved
    differently depending on whether the scope function returned a promise
    (i.e. was an async function), for historical reasons that no longer
    apply. Now that this is fixed, I've codemodded all async act scopes that
    don't contain an await to be sync.
    
    No pressing motivation other than it looks nicer and the codemod was
    easy. Might help avoid confusion for new contributors who see async act
    scopes with nothing async inside and infer it must be like that for a
    reason.

    Update more tests to not rely on sync queuing (#26358)
    
    This fixes a handful of tests that were accidentally relying on React
    synchronously queuing work in the Scheduler after a setState.
    
    Usually this is because they use a lower level SchedulerMock method
    instead of either `act` or one of the `waitFor` helpers. In some cases,
    the solution is to switch to those APIs. In other cases, if we're
    intentionally testing some lower level behavior, we might have to be a
    bit more clever.

    Don't prerender siblings of suspended component  (#26380)
    
    Today if something suspends, React will continue rendering the siblings
    of that component.
    
    Our original rationale for prerendering the siblings of a suspended
    component was to initiate any lazy fetches that they might contain. This
    was when we were more bullish about lazy fetching being a good idea some
    of the time (when combined with prefetching), as opposed to our latest
    thinking, which is that it's almost always a bad idea.
    
    Another rationale for the original behavior was that the render was I/O
    bound, anyway, so we might as do some extra work in the meantime. But
    this was before we had the concept of instant loading states: when
    navigating to a new screen, it's better to show a loading state as soon
    as you can (often a skeleton UI), rather than delay the transition.
    (There are still cases where we block the render, when a suitable
    loading state is not available; it's just not _all_ cases where
    something suspends.) So the biggest issue with our existing
    implementation is that the prerendering of the siblings happens within
    the same render pass as the one that suspended — _before_ the loading
    state appears.
    
    What we should do instead is immediately unwind the stack as soon as
    something suspends, to unblock the loading state.
    
    If we want to preserve the ability to prerender the siblings, what we
    could do is schedule special render pass immediately after the fallback
    is displayed. This is likely what we'll do in the future. However, in
    the new implementation of `use`, there's another reason we don't
    prerender siblings: so we can preserve the state of the stack when
    something suspends, and resume where we left of when the promise
    resolves without replaying the parents. The only way to do this
    currently is to suspend the entire work loop. Fiber does not currently
    support rendering multiple siblings in "parallel". Once you move onto
    the next sibling, the stack of the previous sibling is discarded and
    cannot be restored. We do plan to implement this feature, but it will
    require a not-insignificant refactor.
    
    Given that lazy data fetching is already bad for performance, the best
    trade off for now seems to be to disable prerendering of siblings. This
    gives us the best performance characteristics when you're following best
    practices (i.e. hoist data fetches to Server Components or route
    loaders), at the expense of making an already bad pattern a bit worse.
    
    Later, when we implement resumable context stacks, we can reenable
    sibling prerendering. Though even then the use case will mostly be to
    prerender the CPU-bound work, not lazy fetches.

    Codemod some expiration tests to waitForExpired (#26491)
    
    Continuing my journey to migrate all the Scheduler flush* methods to
    async versions of the same helpers.
    
    `unstable_flushExpired` is a rarely used helper that is only meant to be
    used to test a very particular implementation detail (update starvation
    prevention, or what we sometimes refer to as "expiration").
    
    I've prefixed the new helper with `unstable_`, too, to indicate that our
    tests should almost always prefer one of the other patterns instead.

    Revert "Cleanup enableSyncDefaultUpdate flag (#26236)" (#26528)
    
    This reverts commit b2ae9ddb3b497d16a7c27c051da1827d08871138.
    
    While the feature flag is fully rolled out, these tests are also testing
    behavior set with an unstable flag on root, which for now we want to
    preserve.
    
    Not sure if there's a better way then adding a dynamic feature flag to
    the www build?

    Remove JND delay for non-transition updates (#26597)
    
    Updates that are marked as part of a transition are allowed to block a
    render from committing. Generally, other updates cannot — however,
    there's one exception that's leftover from a previous iteration of our
    Suspense architecture. If an update is not the result of a known urgent
    event type — known as "Default" updates — then we allow it to suspend
    briefly, as long as the delay is short enough that the user won't
    notice. We refer to this delay as a "Just Noticable Difference" (JND)
    delay. To illustrate, if the user has already waited 400ms for an update
    to be reflected on the screen, the theory is that they won't notice if
    you wait an additional 100ms. So React can suspend for a bit longer in
    case more data comes in. The longer the user has already waited, the
    longer the JND.
    
    While we still believe this theory is sound from a UX perspective, we no
    longer think the implementation complexity is worth it. The main thing
    that's changed is how we handle Default updates. We used to render
    Default updates concurrently (i.e. they were time sliced, and were
    scheduled with postTask), but now they are blocking. Soon, they will
    also be scheduled with rAF, too, which means by the end of the next rAF,
    they will have either finished rendering or the main thread will be
    blocked until they do. There are various motivations for this but part
    of the rationale is that anything that can be made non-blocking should
    be marked as a Transition, anyway, so it's not worth adding
    implementation complexity to Default.
    
    This commit removes the JND delay for Default updates. They will now
    commit immediately once the render phase is complete, even if a
    component suspends.

    Clean up enableSyncDefaultUpdates flag a bit (#26858)
    
    ## Overview
    
    Does a few things:
    - Renames `enableSyncDefaultUpdates` to
    `forceConcurrentByDefaultForTesting`
    - Changes the way it's used so it's dead-code eliminated separate from
    `allowConcurrentByDefault`
    - Deletes a bunch of the gated code
    
    The gates that are deleted are unnecessary now. We were keeping them
    when we originally thought we would come back to being concurrent by
    default. But we've shifted and now sync-by default is the desired
    behavior long term, so there's no need to keep all these forked tests
    around.
    
    I'll follow up to delete more of the forked behavior if possible.
    Ideally we wouldn't need this flag even if we're still using
    `allowConcurrentByDefault`.

    Revert "[Tests] Reset modules by default" (#28318)
    
    This was causing a slowdown in one of the tests
    ESLintRuleExhaustiveDeps-test.js. Reverting until we figure out why.

    Remove forceConcurrentByDefaultForTesting flag (#30436)
    
    Concurrent by default has been unshipped! Let's clean it up.
    
    Here we remove `forceConcurrentByDefaultForTesting`, which allows us to
    run tests against both concurrent strategies. In the next PR, we'll
    remove the actual concurrent by default code path.

    Schedule prerender after something suspends (#30800)
    
    Adds the concept of a "prerender". These special renders are spawned
    whenever something suspends (and we're not already prerendering).
    
    The purpose is to move speculative rendering work into a separate phase
    that does not block the UI from updating. For example, during a
    transition, if something suspends, we should not speculatively prerender
    siblings that will be replaced by a fallback in the UI until *after* the
    fallback has been shown to the user.

    Prerender during same pass if blocked anyway (#30879)
    
    If something suspends in the shell — i.e. we won't replace the suspended
    content with a fallback — we might as well prerender the siblings during
    the current render pass, instead of spawning a separate prerender pass.
    
    This is implemented by setting the "is prerendering" flag to true
    whenever we suspend in the shell. But only if we haven't already skipped
    over some siblings, because if so, then we need to schedule a separate
    prerender pass regardless.

    [Fiber] Schedule passive effects using the regular ensureRootIsScheduled flow (#31785)
    
    This treats workInProgressRoot work and rootWithPendingPassiveEffects
    the same way. Basically as long as there's some work on the root, yield
    the current task. Including passive effects. This means that passive
    effects are now a continuation instead of a separate callback. This can
    mean they're earlier or later than before. Later for Idle in case
    there's other non-React work. Earlier for same Default if there's other
    Default priority work.
    
    This makes sense since increasing priority of the passive effects beyond
    Idle doesn't really make sense for an Idle render.
    
    However, for any given render at same priority it's more important to
    complete this work than start something new.
    
    Since we special case continuations to always yield to the browser, this
    has the same effect as #31784 without implementing `requestPaint`. At
    least assuming nothing else calls `requestPaint`.
