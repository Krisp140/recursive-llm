-/// A struct to help execute commands on the host via the

-/// under the hood.
-///
-/// This always spawns its own thread and maintains its own GLib event loop.
-/// This makes it easy for the command to behave synchronously similar to
-/// std.process.Child.
-///
-/// There are lots of chances for low-hanging improvements here (automatic
-/// pipes, /dev/null, etc.) but this was purpose built for my needs so
-/// it doesn't have all of those.
-///
-/// Requires GIO, GLib to be available and linked.
